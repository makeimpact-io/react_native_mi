Our aim with this post is to show you how a possible impact 💥 investment can be made, allowing you to put your money 💰 where your heart is ❤️.</p>\n\n<h4>💥Justice💥</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/24953183/giphy__homer_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/24953183/giphy__homer_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The fifth area &mdash; Justice &mdash; consists of SDG 16 (Peace ☮️ , Justice ⚖️ &nbsp;and Strong Institutions 🏋️).</p>\n\n<p>Without Justice, the hope of a sustainable world&nbsp;🌍&nbsp;only becomes more difficult to fulfill. But what really is Justice&nbsp;🦸&zwj;♀️? Justice is when there is peace, everyone is treated fairly, and there are unbiased laws&nbsp;📖&nbsp;to protect people. Sadly, many countries are still reaching this goal 😒. But why is it so difficult for some countries to achieve peaceful stability that other countries have been enjoying for years?</p>\n\n<p>When sexual violence, war, and social insecurity is part of your everyday life&nbsp;⛓, any positive development will be a far reach🖐. This is what the SDGs aim to change&nbsp;🔧. Positive change towards justice relies on strengthening&nbsp;🏋️&nbsp;the rule of law, promoting human rights 🌍, and making developing countries interact with global governance 🏛.</p>\n\n<h4>Our 3 companies for Justice!</h4>\n\n<p>We think the following three companies are setting great examples 😁 of businesses 🏢 where you can start your impact investing and thereby start making a change 🤝:</p>\n\n<p><strong>NORDEN A/S 🚢</strong></p>\n\n<p>This Danish shipping company has created a responsible supply chain management system called IMPA ACT! Run by the International Marine Purchasing Association, IMPA ACT is the first standard for the shipping industry in this area. This system requires buyers like NORDEN to agree 🤝 to implement the stipulations of a Supplier Code of Conduct that has been based on the same UN Global Compact 🗺 that we have talked about. Overall, by Norden helping develop IMPA ACT, they have created a safer and more just shipping system that will affect the lives of workers 👩&zwj;🏭 throughout the world 🌎.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Coloplast A/S 🏥</strong></p>\n\n<p>A healthcare equipment company native to Denmark, Coloplast focuses on helping people fix their ailments and live more complete lives. This business has put in place a Code of Conduct that has reduced the number of injuries by 33% since 2017! Even cooler 😆, they have consistently been able to increase their share of women in top management year over year 👩&zwj;💼. Finally, they have done an amazing job at screening their material suppliers for human and labor rights 🔦.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Securitas AB 🕵️</strong></p>\n\n<p>Securitas is a security service company that is based out of Stockholm, Sweden 🇸🇪 with over 300,000 employees worldwide 🌎. Already built into the heart of the company, providing a sense of security 🔒 to the general public has been the very job of Securitas since its start. By promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, Securitas has done an amazing job at providing access to justice for all ☮️.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Be The Movement!

Still, the real power of this tool is often far overlooked by individual investors. Today we are going to help you take a grasp of the&nbsp;complete image of diversification.&nbsp;🧑&zwj;💻</p>\n\n<p>You may have heard the old saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put all of your eggs into one basket.&rdquo; Many people think this is what diversification means.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>~ To hold more than a handful of stocks to protect your returns. ~</p>\n\n<p>While this is accurate, there is far more to diversification than meets the eye. So much so that the largest hedge fund in the world calls it the &ldquo;Holy Grail of Investing.&rdquo; So what is diversification? 🤷&zwj;♀️</p>\n\n<p><strong>It really is the idea of buying the whole store, seriously. 🍗🥦🥔🥒🥓🍫</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25350312/giphy-4.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25350312/giphy-4.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>A great way to describe diversification is to use the traditional grocery store example 😁. When you are shopping you aren&rsquo;t going to just buy one item 💪. You want to enjoy a full and balanced diet. You will need proteins, grains, veggies, fruits, and maybe even a couple of beers 👀. No matter how much you enjoy it, your body can&rsquo;t run off of only one food group. Your investment portfolio is the same. Even if you are having an awesome time only buying tech stocks, eventually it will catch up to you. 😿😾</p>\n\n<p>So that&rsquo;s what you then set up to do. Buy great stocks in the other &ldquo;food groups&rdquo; or industries. Buy some stock in your favorite stores around town 🤝. Buy some stock in airline companies with strong long-term potential 🛫. Even buy some stock in your favorite food companies. Ok, awesome we have done it, Diversification achieved!</p>\n\n<p>Actually, no. 🙇🏻&zwj;♂️</p>\n\n<p>While you have built a strong base of diversified common stocks, you can still achieve even more diversification 🤔. First, let&#39;s check out some international stocks in a stable foreign market. Adding foreign stock to your portfolio can help protect against large scale market downturns in your home country 💂&zwj;♀️. Plus, you get to say you&#39;re an ~international investor~ (Pretty Cool) 😎.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Wait but what about some bonds? Why not add in some government treasury bonds or corporate bonds to lock in some returns for your portfolio? Yeah, not a bad idea 😁. But what if you could then diversify these bonds? Like maybe some foreign bonds? Now you&#39;re cooking. 😲🤝</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25350355/giphy-5.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25350355/giphy-5.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>As you can imagine this trend continues by moving throughout all of the assets offered to individual investors. Everything from foreign currencies to even collectibles like vintage cars and paintings. 💎 By dividing your money throughout a collection of different uncorrelated things that will gain value, you set yourself up for long-term gains with limited risk. 🚀</p>\n\n<h4>The Holy Grail of Investing? 🤫</h4>\n\n<p>While this strategy is not going to bring you millions tomorrow, it is a pretty solid way to lock in millions in say 30 years. That&rsquo;s still pretty nice if you ask me. 😬</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25350455/giphy-6.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25350455/giphy-6.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4><strong>The Bottomline 📖</strong></h4>\n\n<p>There is so much of a focus on diversification because holding a group of stocks, bonds, and other assets that move in different ways, helps you maintain long-term compounding returns 🧮. Using diversification can decrease one&rsquo;s risk and help lock in long-term growth that is not seen by buying stocks in only one or two industries 🏭. Overall, by knowing the true power of diversification, you are setting yourself up to obtain serious long-term gains 🤑.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n","a_creation":"22/06/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

Once entering the jungle of investing, we can get easily sidetracked into endless distractions, emotions, and false information that can lead us to end up losing money 🤦&zwj;♂️.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Yeah this doesn&rsquo;t sound too fun, but you are already here reading this, so at least you have that step up over your peers 👩&zwj;🎓. By identifying these barriers to positive investment, you can help yourself become a better investor in the long run 🚀.</p>\n\n<h4><strong>Emotions 🤩🥵😰</strong></h4>\n\n<p>Playing the markets can quickly become emotional. Depending on the stocks you are investing in, you can suddenly see large swings in your account balance that can lead to all sorts of emotions 🔥.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Because investing is tied entirely to money, our emotions can be polarized 🧲. One second you are an investment genius, the next second you are a gambling degenerate. People naturally like to call the stocks that make them money &ldquo;smart investments&rdquo; while the stocks that lose them money are &ldquo;uneducated bets.&rdquo; For the investors that are able to get past their pride and recognize their strong stocks, their honest mistakes, and their own luck, these investors will be better set up to bring in long-run gains 💸.</p>\n\n<h4>Account Size 💰</h4>\n\n<p>Most people start off with modest account sizes but like everyone else, they have hopes of high gains 📈. Everyone wants to be sitting on their yacht in the Meditteranean answering questions on how their ingenious landed them there 🏝. Because of these natural goals of wanting financial freedom, people will be interested in putting all of their accounts into one or two relatively cheap stocks. Rarely does this work ☹️.</p>\n\n<p>Combining market fluctuations and human emotions, the account value can suddenly dive and you will quickly be angered 🤬. Those new to the market may move out of that one stock and move to another stock they feel is better set up for financial gains. Following this cycle of buying high and selling low, their accounts slowly drift to zero 😳.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is important to realize the strengths and weaknesses of one&rsquo;s own account size 🧮. Getting into investing is great no matter what amount you can contribute to your account. Just make sure you are diversifying your account with great companies that will give you long-term growth instead of only one or two stocks that you believe will give you massive short-term gains 🤔.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>The Knowledge Gap 📚</h4>\n\n<p>The markets are a jungle 🐯. Each day there are millions of different events, mindsets, voices, and beliefs that are shifting separate sections of the market ⚖️. As smaller investors, we are caught in the middle of all of this 🥵.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We love to believe that we are smarter than the rest and can outperform the market 🕺. Furthermore, we love to tell each other our investment ideas that may have little to no merit 🗣. A constant flow of amateur investment media, online investment gurus, and heavy wall street jargon has only complicated the investment process. Most new investors do not have the time or the interest to be analyzing macroeconomics and business fundamentals, so how do we deal with this 🤷&zwj;♀️?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25350077/giphy-2.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25350077/giphy-2.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>Our Investing Tips! 🤓</h4>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Be Honest.

Which goes further than just contributing to greenwashing campaigns? Let&rsquo;s find out together!</p>\n\n<h4>Reducing our carbon footprint for a sustainable future</h4>\n\n<p>In our daily routines, we often contribute to our carbon footprint. From our food intake to our energy consumption, much of what requires energy to produce or use goes hand-in-hand with carbon emissions. So what would be a more sustainable carbon emissions strategy? 🤔</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>AVOID ❌<br />\n\tNaturally,&nbsp;avoiding&nbsp;carbon-emitting activities in the first place is the best way to improve our carbon footprint. Tough, but optimal!<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>REDUCE, REUSE &amp; RECYCLE ♻️<br />\n\tWhen avoiding is not an option, reducing one&rsquo;s emissions where possible by recycling products and reusing them instead of purchasing replacements also contributes to the decrease in carbon emissions and, ultimately, a more sustainable future 🌱<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>OFFSET ⬇️ &nbsp;<br />\n\tAs a last resort, offsetting one&rsquo;s emission is another option. In offsetting, a third party is paid to compensate for the greenhouse gases emitted.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25557376/giphy-3.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25557376/giphy-3.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>What specific actions can we take?</h4>\n\n<p><u>At Home:</u>&nbsp;The energy used in our homes comprises, on average, 26% of our total footprint. Wherever you live, here are some steps you can take to reduce your energy use:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Switch to a green energy supplier 💚<br />\n\tBy substituting fossil-fueled energy providers with renewable energy, we make sure that less unsustainably produced energy is produced and decrease our carbon emissions ☀️</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Stop heating an empty home 🏡&nbsp;Heating and cooling can account for up to 44% of energy use. Try to keep the temperatures down when you are at work or on vacation &ndash; it cuts down your energy bill as well! 💰</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Turn appliances off at the power source 📺 Flipping the switch on the wall makes a huge difference. Devices in stand-by continue to use energy, something referred to as phantom load 👻 You can also avoid using stand-by energy by installing smart plugs that allow you to remotely to turn off all power at a given socket or schedule its hours of operation.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><u>Travel:</u>&nbsp;Your carbon footprint depends a lot on how you get from A to B. If you decide to leave the car in favour of walking or cycling 🚴&zwj;♂️, you can save up to 2.4 tonnes of CO2e per year. Moreover, airplanes emit thousands tonnes of carbon gases &nbsp;&ndash; reducing air travel and focusing on greener airlines helps reduce our footprint to save the planet. ✈️🌱</p>\n\n<p><u>Diet:</u>&nbsp;Carbon emissions are generated in both the production and transportation of food products. In a perfect world, the entire globe would go vegan right now 🥦 Cutting out all meat and dairy products would slash out eight of the top ten foods contributing to greenhouse gas emissions completely 🥩🧀 But if this sounds like too much of a stretch, we can also do the following to reduce our footprint:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Reduce meat consumption:&nbsp;Make educated choices about your consumption. For example, lamb 🐑 is considered the worst for your carbon footprint, followed by beef 🐮</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Buy fresh and local 🤘Food miles have an enormous impact on your carbon footprint. Buying seasonal items also goes hand-in-hand with avoiding distant transport 🚛Fresh food also reduces your footprint in comparison to frozen food, which requires much energy to produce and freeze ❄️</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25557570/giphy-5.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25557570/giphy-5.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><u>Shopping:</u>&nbsp;Clothes are overconsumed in our fast-fashion industry 👖British charity Barnardo&rsquo;s estimates that fast fashion items are worn, on average, seven times before being chucked away 🗑 The environmental impact of this trend is huge: one cotton t-shirt manufactured in China has a footprint of 8.77 kg C02e. Here is what you can do to counter this trend:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Buy used instead of new items:&nbsp;Many resale websites have sprung up in recent years offering many varieties of quality second-hand clothing 🙌</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Take extra good care of your clothes:&nbsp;Be more gentle with your clothes to increase their expected lifetime 🧺 If your clothes do become unwearable, consider fixing them yourself or contact your local tailor 🧶</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><u>Work:</u>&nbsp;During COVID-19, many started working from home. However, our laptop is not impact-free either 💻 Every time we search, stream or download, there is an electricity-hungry data centre somewhere making it happen. Therefore, reducing our internet consumption time goes hand-in-hand with lowering our carbon footprint 🌱</p>\n\n<h4>Invest for impact</h4>\n\n<p>These actions help tackle climate change in our own lives and are very important for a more sustainable future. Together, we can strengthen the movement and create the change we want 💪<br />\n<br />\nIs this all we can do? Not quite yet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Another big piece of the climate change puzzle is changing the behaviour of corporations. Between 1965 and 2017, 480 billion tonnes of CO2e have been released into the atmosphere &ndash; and that can all be tracked to just twenty companies 👎 The best way to change their behaviour is through impact investing 📈: buying stocks, bonds, and other assets of companies which support the values you stand for. Via impact investing, we can provide the great companies out there with the necessary funding to drive the green transformation we need 💚</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25557738/giphy-6.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25557738/giphy-6.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n","a_creation":"27/06/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

Awesome! But what are they? 🤔</h4>\n\n<p>Two types of investment funds are Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). These funds are run by groups of professionals&nbsp;🧑&zwj;💼&nbsp;who have dedicated their lives to studying stocks and portfolios. Essentially they do the job of investing for you while you sit back and reap the returns 📈.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s pretty great 😎.</p>\n\n<p>A good analogy for why to use an investment fund is similar to why you would go out to eat. Even if you are a good cook, it is nice to have someone else do the job for you while you sit back and relax. 👨&zwj;🍳🥙</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25517620/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25517620/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>Ok, but still, what is the difference between Exchange Traded Funds and Mutual Funds? 🤓</h4>\n\n<p>They are similar in the sense that both pool money from crowds of investors to create diverse portfolios to help grow their investor&rsquo;s money📈. However, there are some key differences that are important to know when deciding which one will better meet your investment goals 🧗.</p>\n\n<h4><strong>Let&rsquo;s Talk Liquidity! 🌊</strong></h4>\n\n<p>ETFs have the unique ability to be bought and sold throughout the day. (In Wall Street slang this means they are Liquid 🌊). This is because they are passively managed, meaning they will usually try to follow a group of stocks in an index, industry, or particular style of investing. Because of this, the holdings of an ETF are rarely changed during the day ⏱.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A mutual fund, on the other hand, is actively managed, meaning that the professionals invest across multiple sectors and industries throughout the day⏳. &nbsp;Therefore, mutual funds can only be bought when the stock market closes 🕰. (Meaning it is less liquid than an ETF ❄️). Such is because the holdings of the mutual fund can shift if the professionals think it is smarter to change up the portfolio 🧮.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the professionals running Mutual Funds are more focused on returns 📈 while professionals in charge of Exchange Traded Funds are focused on seeing their investment choices make long-term gains 💪.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For this reason, fees associated with mutual funds can be higher than ETFs &mdash; since you&rsquo;re paying a professional for their ongoing advice 🕺.</p>\n\n<h4>So why does this matter? 💁&zwj;♂️</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25517838/giphy-2.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25517838/giphy-2.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>It is really all based on your investment opinions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Maybe you think the long-term holding of an index is the best way to invest your money. &nbsp;🤷&zwj;♂️</p>\n\n<p>Maybe you think it is better to have the professionals actively watch over your money for you. 🤷&zwj;♀️</p>\n\n<p>There is no right answer. Just like how people argue over the best restaurants, people also argue over investment styles. It&rsquo;s a part of life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>But how does this tie into Sustainable Investing? 🌍</h4>\n\n<p>A great part about both ETFs and Mutual Funds is that they can be specialized to help guide your own sustainable investing 🌿.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If part of your investment strategy is to invest in companies that promote, for example, gender equality, you could choose a targeted socially responsible ETF that will invest your money in a variety of companies with high levels of gender diversity in leadership positions. 😁</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you could choose a mutual fund that invests in a diverse range of companies but specifically&nbsp;not&nbsp;tobacco, weapons, or gambling. 😎</p>\n\n<p>Both options allow you to invest your money in line with your values, just in different ways.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Overall, neither type of fund is better or worse than the other. Factors such as risk and return on your investment depend more on the specific portfolio itself, rather than what type of fund you chose. 🤓</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s more of a question of what is better for your needs and interests. If you are really split, you could even diversify your own portfolio by holding both ETFs and Mutual Funds at the same time. 😄🤝👨&zwj;🍳</p>\n\n","a_creation":"01/07/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

For a company, launching an IPO can be risky, so it&rsquo;s something it plans well in advance before taking the final, big step 🚶&zwj;♀️A public offering costs the firm quite some money (3.5% - 7% of the IPO proceeds) and is a lengthy process, but if things go well, it can help the business expand and increase its profits 💰🌟</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25764396/giphy4.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25764396/giphy4.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>2️⃣ Once a company goes public, it becomes tradable on the market. If the IPO does well, investors may take notice and invest further in the company, thus giving it more funds to grow and expand its operations. BUT, there is a catch: if a company does<em>&nbsp;not</em>&nbsp;do well, its brand may lose face and lead to a decline in the value of the company as its share price falls 😯📉</p>\n\n<p>3️⃣ While it may sound great to invest in companies shortly after their IPO, it&rsquo;s generally not recommended for new investors 🤷&zwj;♀️In the first year after an IPO, share prices tend to fluctuate significantly. It might also be hard to find unbiased information about the company&rsquo;s financial situation since, most of the time, all early reports come from the company itself 🕵️&zwj;♂️ Therefore, IPO investing is considered to be&nbsp;<em>high-risk</em>&nbsp;investing.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not all bad, though! With time, third parties release more reliable information about the company and their stock, so it might not be a bad idea to wait around after an IPO and see what happens 🤞</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25764445/giphy5.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25764445/giphy5.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>That being said, it can be interesting to track companies that plan to launch (or have recently launched) an IPO and to watch out for familiar brands. For example, in December 2020, the rental company Airbnb went public. Whilst the sharing economy has been on the rise, the global coronavirus outbreak has also severely impacted travel. It will be interesting to see what happens next and how the future share price of Airbnb will develop!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25765013/giphy3.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25765013/giphy3.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max\" /></a></p>\n\n","a_creation":"04/07/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

Once these expenses are paid, you get the ⬇️</p>\n\n<p><strong>Profit before tax</strong>&nbsp;💥 An important shout: taxes vary from country to country, so you might find a company that&rsquo;s good at making a profit with low expenses but on the other hand is affected by higher tax rates ⚖️ The solution to finding an even more exact glimpse into a company&rsquo;s profit is to look at the ⬇️</p>\n\n<p><strong>Net profit&nbsp;</strong>💥 &nbsp;Also known as net earnings or net income! It&rsquo;s defined as the total profit the company makes after all expenses and taxes are deducted. From such a number, you&rsquo;re able to tell whether a company has made a profit or a loss in the time period you&rsquo;re interested in 🤓</p>\n\n<h4><em><strong>So we like profit &ndash; but does it come at a cost?</strong></em></h4>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in investing with an impact, it&rsquo;s essential to look past the numbers and learn&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;the company is making a profit. Your investment is buying into a company carrying out a specific type of business, so you need to be sure that your company is using your money in a way that is in line with your values 👐 💓</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25718250/giphy2.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>For example ...</strong>&nbsp;each year,&nbsp;<strong>Company X</strong>&nbsp;makes good profit. Yet, this profit is largely due to the fact that it minimizes its expenses by paying its employees less than minimum wage and by using cheap materials for its products that may harm the environment 🧪 The long-term effects of these practices have global consequences that affect human rights and climate change 🌍🔥</p>\n\n<p><strong>Company Y</strong>, on the other hand, also makes rather good profit, but instead chooses to source material for its products locally and pay their employees a fair wage 👯&zwj;♂️ 🎉 In choosing between these two companies, you as an investor have a great deal of power! You can choose profit on its own &ndash; or, you can choose profit coupled with sustainability ♻️</p>\n\n<p><strong>Remember:</strong>&nbsp;just because a company values sustainability, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that it will be more or less profitable than others. As you learn more about investing, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important to be aware of impact and how it relates to basic economic concepts 😍</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25764690/micheile-henderson-lZ_4nPFKcV8-unsplash.jpg?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/25764690/micheile-henderson-lZ_4nPFKcV8-unsplash.jpg?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n","a_creation":"06/07/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

One way to avoid the risk of a single stock (also called idiosyncratic risk) is to diversify. You have two ways to diversify:&nbsp;<strong>1)</strong>&nbsp;to create your own basket of stocks &ndash; your own portfolio, or&nbsp;<strong>2)</strong>, to buy an existing &lsquo;basket&rsquo; of stocks &ndash; a so-called&nbsp;<strong>stock index</strong>.</p>\n\n<h4>So, what&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a stock market index? 🤔</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26085823/giphy__6_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26085823/giphy__6_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>A stock market index is basically a performance-evaluating tool that tracks the performance of a hypothetical basket of stocks. There are many different types of indices, each representing a portion of the overall market and tracking a different basket of stocks. These baskets can be sector-specific, trend-specific, asset class-specific or geography-specific 🔬🏗🚆 These different indices give a general idea of &lsquo;how the market/sector/.... is doing&rsquo; by comparing the stock prices 👌&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here are a few of the most popular stock market indices to keep in mind:</strong></p>\n\n<p>1️⃣ MSCI World Index (tracks 1,562 stocks worldwide)</p>\n\n<p>2️⃣ FTSE 100 Index (tracks the 100 largest stocks listed on the London Stock Exchange)</p>\n\n<p>3️⃣ S&amp;P 500 Index (tracks the 500 largest American companies)</p>\n\n<p>4️⃣ Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (tracks the 30 most prominent American companies)</p>\n\n<h4>You might ask: &lsquo;Just to be sure, how is it again that the price of a share is determined?&rsquo;</h4>\n\n<p>Just as food is bought and sold in a grocery market, shares are bought and sold on the stock market 🏛&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26085878/giphy__4_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26085878/giphy__4_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The prices of fresh products on the food market are often fixed, but on the stock exchange the prices work like an auction (as in supply and demand). This means that buyers name the highest price they are willing to pay and sellers name the lowest price they are willing to accept 🔓In the end, the final price is settled somewhere in between 🤝&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>These negotiations take place via electronic trading platforms or through the use of professional stockbrokers who manage clients&rsquo; portfolios on their behalf.</p>\n\n<h4>What are indices and how do they work?</h4>\n\n<p>There are specialized companies called index providers (e.g. Bloomberg, MSCI, S&amp;P) that decide which stocks are included in the &lsquo;basket&rsquo; and how the weighting of each stock is determined 🎯</p>\n\n<p>The indices can be weighted by different methods that basically determine the weight of a company within the index ⚖️Depending on the weight of the company, the performance of the individual company can have a bigger or minor impact on the overall performance of the index.</p>\n\n<p>In the MSCI World index, for example, the largest company is Apple with a weight of about 4 percent. The second largest is Microsoft (3.2 percent), followed by Amazon (2.6 percent) 💪</p>\n\n<h4>How can you invest in an index?</h4>\n\n<p>You can easily invest in an index by buying into an index fund. These index funds are a simple and inexpensive way to become exposed to the selected &lsquo;basket&rsquo; of stocks 🛒&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So how exactly does it work? Basically, the index fund uses a replicating method to copy the index and buy and hold the underlying stocks 👩&zwj;💻These funds are then only adjusted when there&rsquo;s a change in the underlying index.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, when you invest in an index, it might be good to take a look at&nbsp;<strong>the expense ratio</strong>&nbsp;🚨This tells you how much you pay to hold a given index. Furthermore, it identifies the percentage of each dollar invested that&rsquo;s used to cover management and operational costs. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://club.makeimpact.io/posts/what-is-a-mutual-fund-and-an-etf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>ETFs</strong></a>&nbsp;are a new financial tool and offer a very low-cost alternative compared to actively managed funds 💥</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26085953/giphy__7_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26085953/giphy__7_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>And remember:</strong>&nbsp;based on your own values and interests, you decide what to invest in and how. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to do your own research before you start investing your money 🚀</p>\n\n","a_creation":"08/07/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

When the price of a stock rises, investors typically don&rsquo;t want to purchase less of it &ndash; instead, they may actually be more attracted to the given share if it increases in value. 👀🔥&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Where the theory does apply is in a company&rsquo;s sales and operations. If the demand for a company&rsquo;s product increases they will sell more of it, and, as a result, the company rises in value. Now, the demand for the company&rsquo;s stock increases! 🌠</p>\n\n<p>This means that we can break the demand&rsquo;s influence on the stock market down to this: If there&rsquo;s a notable increase in the demand for a company&rsquo;s goods or services, it typically leads to an increase in the stock&rsquo;s share price. 📈</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26220704/giphy__10_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>\n\n<h4>For example &hellip;&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at the company Apple Inc. 🍎 If Apple were to increase the price of their iPhones they would most likely sell fewer since less people would be able to afford them. 📱 This would lead to a decrease in profits and 🔜 to a lower value of the company, which could scare away potential investors. As a consequence, the share price of Apple would decrease.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if Apple could afford to lower the prices of their iPhones, this would plausibly lead to more sales, potentially increasing profits 🤔💰 This would mean an increase in company value, attracting more investors and an increasing stock price.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One final thing to be aware of is some products&rsquo;&nbsp;<strong>price elasticity</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; the responsiveness of demand to a change in price. If a product&rsquo;s price elasticity is low, the change in demand is only minor compared to the price change. For example, if there&rsquo;s a price change in a necessity such as insulin 💉we&rsquo;re likely to keep on buying it &ndash; unlike iPhones which can be substituted for another product!</p>\n\n<p>But how does supply and demand relate to impact investing?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s pretty straightforward: If you&rsquo;re interested in driving a sustainable future with your investments, you should be aware that simply because there&rsquo;s demand for a product or service does not mean that it equals sustainability. 🙅&zwj;♂️</p>\n\n<p>For example, you might want to look into a company&rsquo;s reports on their ESG benchmarks ♻️ and ask yourself if the demand for their product and the potential growth of the business would also leave a positive impact on the world.

This is different from businesses that are nonprofits, organizations, or sole proprietorship firms. It&rsquo;s important to be aware of this difference as it explains why there are some institutions you can donate to but not invest in, as for example Save the Children 👶🌍</p>\n\n<p>A corporation is a group of people that is legally recognised as a single entity. Sometimes a corporation is even referred to as a &lsquo;legal person&rsquo; since it must act within the same laws as any ordinary person ⚖️For example, a business can enter into contracts, own property, borrow money, and be sued &ndash; just like normal people 👨&zwj;👨&zwj;👧&zwj;👦</p>\n\n<p>For business owners, the greatest benefit of registering as a corporation is that if the company takes on debt, it is the corporation that is liable to pay it off &ndash; not the business owners personally. This is different from a business that&rsquo;s registered as a partnership where, should the business be unable to pay off its debts, the partners are at risk of losing their personal assets 🙇&zwj;♂️</p>\n\n<h4>How does this relate to investing?</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26219310/giphy__8_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26219310/giphy__8_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>When a corporation starts selling part of their business in the form of securities (that&rsquo;s stocks and bonds, for example 💰), they first go through an&nbsp;<strong>Initial Public Offering (IPO)</strong>. This means that the public (that&rsquo;s people like you 👸) can start investing in the corporation. Corporations can also be privately traded by big, institutional investors, but the stock market that we as everyday people deal with only comprises publicly traded corporations.</p>\n\n<p>Corporations essentially want people to invest in them so that they can grow their business. Having shareholders (people who own stock) provides the corporation with more money without having to take out loans from banks 💅Instead, the shareholders own part of the business and, sometimes, the company shares the profits and pays them out as a dividend (stay tuned on m!club to learn more about what this means for your investments!)</p>\n\n<h4>For example...</h4>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s say Company X develops an innovative technology for electric cars and has big plans for the future 🚙👩&zwj;🔧</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26219316/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26219316/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>In order to grow, the company needs more money. Instead of taking out a loan and paying interest on the loan, the company decides to register as a corporation and goes public through an IPO 💪</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, a new investor wants to invest a portion of their money in a sustainable corporation. They choose Company X since it&rsquo;s a company who is both passionate about environmental issues and has a product that promotes the use of electric cars ♻️🚀</p>\n\n<p>By having such shareholders, Company X can use their newly earned investments to further invest in&nbsp;research for the&nbsp;development of their product 📚👩&zwj;🔬 As the business grows and makes a profit, shareholders also see their investment grow. And not to forget: as the world grows more aware of sustainability, more people will choose to buy electric cars, which leads to a higher demand for Company X&rsquo;s technology 📈</p>\n\n<p>From the above, here&rsquo;s then some food for thought: as an investor, your decisions have a powerful effect on the world 🌱The corporations you choose to invest your money in will spend it towards developing their product, and if that product supports a sustainable future, your investment is making a positive impact on the world.

Funds typically invest in dozens of stocks &ndash; this means you don&rsquo;t have to worry as much about risk factors as when you put your investable resources in only a few individual stocks. 💅</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26275423/giphy__12_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26275423/giphy__12_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>2️⃣ By pooling your money in a fund, investors cut their investing expenses. When you buy stocks individually, you&rsquo;re the one responsible for all transaction costs. In an investment fund, the fund manager takes care of these expenses. 💁&zwj;♂️ Furthermore, investing expenses appear less intimidating as assets are typically bought in bulk. 🧺</p>\n\n<p>3️⃣ You don&rsquo;t need to know all the details about investing or make all the decisions &mdash; professionals carefully research the market for you. 🧠 and invest in the most promising companies on your behalf.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4><strong>What are the considerations?</strong></h4>\n\n<p>👉 Unlike when you purchase shares in a company directly, with investment funds, you don&rsquo;t get any voting rights in the company. This might be particularly important to you if you are choosing to invest in companies based on their sustainability practices.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26275414/giphy__13_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26275414/giphy__13_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>👉 As the fund is managed by someone else, you need to be confident that they are investing in companies that align with your visions and values. You therefore need to do some background research before you decide which fund may be right for you.</p>\n\n<p>👉 An investment fund may have fees and expenses that you should be aware of, as the price you pay to partake in the fund will impact your financial returns.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To understand what diversifying your portfolio through funds means, consider the case of Company X:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Person A buys stock in Company X because A cares about climate change and Company X works particularly with renewable energy. ♻️☀️ The next quarter, the company performs poorly, so Person A&rsquo;s investment drops significantly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Person B, on the other hand, invests in an investment fund that owns some stock in Company X as one asset among stocks from multiple other companies. 👐🏢 When Company X has a bad quarter, Person B&rsquo;s investment also declines, but less than that of Person A, since Company X is just one part of the fund&rsquo;s portfolio (and Person B&rsquo;s investment!). 😇</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26275495/giphy__14_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26275495/giphy__14_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Now you know the basics of investment funds.

If you plan to align your investments to your values or an existing framework (such as ESG or SRI), it&rsquo;s necessary to know which companies&rsquo; align with those values 🙌 But how exactly do you do that?</p>\n\n<p>This is where&nbsp;<strong>non-governmental organizations (NGOs)&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>non-profit organizations (NPOs)</strong>&nbsp;become useful to you as an investor 💡 Most likely, you&rsquo;ve already heard of the likes of WWF, Greenpeace, Oxfam, and UNICEF &ndash; the list is endless!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While we will not focus on the difference between the two types of organizations, we want to emphasize their strengths 👯&zwj;♀</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26346130/giphy__15_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26346130/giphy__15_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>For example, both types of organizations thrive for social good instead of financial profits. Both are also passionate about their work and try to expose social imbalances, environmental harm next to other local and global grievances 💪🌎 Many of these organizations specialize in one specific area and are directly involved with projects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>1️⃣ Projects and campaigns</h4>\n\n<p>NGOs and NPOs have been in charge of countless remarkable campaigns 🗣ranging from the strengthening of local communities to providing support for victims of violence, advocating for asylum seekers and refugees&rsquo; rights, or promoting women&rsquo;s rights and child protection ⚖️ Recently, more and more projects have started focusing on the conservation of nature and combatting climate change.</p>\n\n<h4>2️⃣ Resources</h4>\n\n<p>Next to campaigning, NGOs and NPOs also provide useful resources on their specialized area of focus 📚🤓 So why not leverage their extensive reports and knowledge and use it to find companies for your portfolio that acts with responsibility?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26346140/giphy__16_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26346140/giphy__16_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t get us wrong &ndash; you cannot invest in NGOs or NPOs! You can only support them by donating to their cause or, for example, by buying their merchandise 💸 This money is then used by the organizations to fund their campaign work. But as investors, we of course also want to put our money to work and let it grow.</p>\n\n<h4>All right - but how do you do that?</h4>\n\n<p><strong>For example &hellip;</strong>&nbsp;You are a new investor and passionate about addressing gender equality 👫You start searching different NGOs focusing on gender equality. In their reports you may find that the company you wanted to invest in is treating their employees like 💩</p>\n\n<p>In the same report, however, the NGO mentioned a competitor for said company which happens to be a role model for the industry &ndash; and voil&agrave;! You&rsquo;ve found a company that aligns better with your values and beliefs 👏</p>\n\n<p>Imagine if everybody would invest in this way! No one would continue to support the bad governance of firm A and would switch to company B 🥳This shift by investors won&rsquo;t go by unnoticed by company A and puts pressure on it to change.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26346168/giphy__17_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26346168/giphy__17_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>All of this is to say that being an informed investor and actively supporting companies that act sustainably gives you a lot of power.

There are two different ways to do so: 1️⃣ integration and 2️⃣ screening.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>Integration</em>&nbsp;put simply, is when you take a specific ESG metric, such as carbon emissions 🏭💨 and try to estimate future impacts in your analysis. The world is moving towards reaching a &lsquo;net zero&rsquo; and almost every country and company plan to reduce most of their carbon emissions. 😷</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26346452/giphy__18_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>\n\n<p>One consequence is that companies emitting large amounts of CO2 through their production of goods are likely to be affected by a higher carbon price since companies need to buy CO2 certificates to offset their pollution. 🌲🌳</p>\n\n<p>If companies continue to emit constant CO2 amounts in spite of higher offsetting prices, the cost of offsetting is bound to increase, which will lead to decreasing profits. The company value would depreciate, leading to a lower share price. 📉 All in all, implementing such metrics into your analysis can help you better assess risks and, ultimately, increase your return on investments. 👏</p>\n\n<p>Another way to approach sustainable finance is to do a&nbsp;<em>screening</em>, where one applies filters to create a &lsquo;basket&rsquo; of stocks or a specific stock index. These filters are based on your investment preferences, values, and ethics. ⚖️ 🌎&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>There are different methods of filtering:</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26346468/giphy__19_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>\n\n<p>👉&nbsp;<em>Negative screening</em>&nbsp;is used to exclude &lsquo;bad&rsquo; stocks, also called sin stocks, from your further analysis. It should be noted, however, that negative screening can hinder your performance and reduce diversification.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>👉 With<em>&nbsp;</em><em>positive screening</em>&nbsp;(also referred to as best-in-class screening 🌟), you simply select a sustainability metric and benchmark all companies in a sector. You then proceed with your analysis using only the companies that perform best according to your metric.</p>\n\n<p>👉&nbsp;<em>Norms-based screening</em>&nbsp;is used to exclude anything that does not meet certain minimum standards such as &lsquo;ILO&rsquo;, &lsquo;the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises&rsquo; or the &lsquo;UN Global Compact&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>We hope you now have a clearer picture of what sustainable investing is. 💰🌱 So let&#39;s jump into the next investment method.</p>\n\n<h4>Thematic investing ...</h4>\n\n<p>is another way to buy shares or other investments that benefit from a certain trend. This trend does not necessarily have to be related to sustainability or social issues. 🤷&zwj;♀️ It can range from hydrogen and electric cars to remote working and meat alternatives. It may also involve higher risk, as investments are concentrated in one industry or sector, potentially leading to increased volatility.</p>\n\n<h4>Impact investing ...</h4>\n\n<p>is a term that first appeared in 2007. It should be noted that impact investing is not a protected term and different definitions exist. One of the most widely recognized definitions is that of the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN). 📖 It defines impact investing as investments specifically aimed to address social or environmental challenges (e.g. education, clean energy, and healthcare). 💓 It can therefore be seen as a subset of thematic investing. Furthermore, impact investing particularly draws upon the concept of the measurability and quantification of impact.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Whew, that was a lot of information!</strong>&nbsp;😅 Hopefully we helped you untangle any messy definitions, and you can now distinguish between the different methods. 🤓 So, let&#39;s start making our portfolios sustainable!

Sounds nice, right? 💁&zwj;♀️</p>\n\n<p>Since 2012, this investment strategy has&nbsp;<strong>grown</strong><a href=\"https://www.ey.com/en_gl/financial-services/why-sustainable-investing-matters\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>&nbsp;at&nbsp;</strong><u><strong>a rate of 107.4% annually</strong></u></a>. In 2020, sustainable investments account for almost 20% of all assets under management. And this number is only projected to rise in the future. 🚀 Millennials, Gen Z, and future generations are expected to continually increase the alignment of their investments with personal values. In a recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/pub/content/dam/msdotcom/infographics/sustainable-investing/Sustainable_Signals_Individual_Investor_White_Paper_Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Morgan Stanley survey</u></a>, 95% of millennial investors cited an interest in sustainable investing &ndash; and approximately one-third of all investors in their 20s and 30s already seek financial advisors providing value-based investing. 🤲👨&zwj;💻</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, macro-economic trends such as a staggering population increase will create bottlenecks in demand for important resources including food, water, and energy. 😨</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26433223/giphy__1_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26433223/giphy__1_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This means that innovative solutions will be required to tackle resource scarcity, clean sanitation or the provision of clean water. 👩&zwj;🔧🏗 In turn, sustainable investment opportunities will continue to grow and most likely accelerate, with corporations relying on necessary funding to fulfill their missions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Trade-off between profit and impact</h4>\n\n<p>Definitions and statistics about impact investing aside, the big question remains: do we have to sacrifice our financial return in order to invest impactfully? And if so, how much? 🤷&zwj;♂️</p>\n\n<p>In case these concerns are on your mind &ndash; don&rsquo;t worry! You&rsquo;re not alone on this. 👫 In fact,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/pub/content/dam/msdotcom/infographics/sustainable-investing/Sustainable_Signals_Individual_Investor_White_Paper_Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the&nbsp;<u>number one doubt for 79% of individual investors</u>&nbsp;concerning sustainable investments is on such investments&rsquo; performance</a>. Yet, let us debunk these fears: to this date, the very vast majority of empirical evidence claims these beliefs to be false. ❌</p>\n\n<p>👉 For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://funds.rbcgam.com/_assets-custom/pdf/RBC-GAM-does-SRI-hurt-investment-returns.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>The Royal Bank of Canada</u></a>&nbsp;analyzed over 50 major studies and concluded that socially responsible investments do not result in lower financial returns.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>👉 Similarly, researchers from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://socialimpact.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Great-Expectations-Mission-Preservation-and-Financial-Performance-in-Impact-Investing.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Wharton Social Impact Initiative</u></a>&nbsp;investigated 53 impact-investing private equity funds and found that there was no evidence to establish a compromise between maximizing financial returns and impact.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>👉 Harvard University scholars also found&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/the-impact-of-corporate-sustainability-on-organizational-process-and-performance\" target=\"_blank\"><u>similar positive conclusions</u></a>, and so did researchers from the University of Hamburg in 2015 when they&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287126190_ESG_and_financial_performance_Aggregated_evidence_from_more_than_2000_empirical_studies\" target=\"_blank\"><u>examined more than 2000 studies</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The reasoning behind all these studies is quite straightforward: by integrating sustainability factors into the investment process, companies that are expected to perform poorly over time due to engagement in unsustainable activities are eliminated as possible investments. 🙅&zwj;♀️📉 In even simpler terms: your investments will be future-proof because the companies in your portfolio will be future-proof!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Long story short&nbsp;</strong>➡️<strong>&nbsp;tear down your fears</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; impact and financial returns do not oppose each other and you can maximise both objectives at the same time. 🤞</p>\n\n<p>So what are you waiting for?

That&rsquo;s why, as Melinda Gates put it, it&rsquo;s wise to invest in women, since &lsquo;when we invest in women and girls, we are investing in the people who invest in everyone else.&rsquo; ♻️</p>\n\n<p>Some might believe that to get more women to start investing, one should focus on women&rsquo;s financial literacy or having more women talk to financial advisors. Yet, these conceptions might be a bit outdated. Here&rsquo;s why 📣:</p>\n\n<p>Women who invest tend to do so with patience and also take fewer risks. However, this does not mean that they don&rsquo;t take risks. They just tend to be more prone to spending more time researching a stock before making an investment decision 🤓 Additionally, studies show that men are more confident in their investing decisions &ndash; even sometimes overconfident. So, while men trade 45% more often than women, female investors&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/woman-better-investors/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>outperform their male counterparts each year by half a percentage point</u></a>&nbsp;👯&zwj;♀️💸</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26658021/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26658021/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>To summarize, there are two reasons that suggest it is important to get more women investing:&nbsp;<em><strong>1)</strong></em>&nbsp;they invest a greater proportion of their money in their local communities than men,&nbsp;<strong><em>2)</em></strong>&nbsp;they tend to make wise investment decisions when they choose to invest 🙇&zwj;♀️ So, it is easy to see how we might see more investments with impact if more women invest!</p>\n\n<h4>So why don&#39;t more women invest?&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>Even in parts of the world where men and women juggle household duties equally, it is still mostly women who take responsibility in planning and delegating said tasks. In recent research, it&rsquo;s been called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.etoro.com/news-and-analysis/copytrader/how-social-trading-could-help-narrow-the-gender-wealth-gap/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>&lsquo;the mental load&rsquo;</u></a>&nbsp;🤯 meaning that women often end up thinking of more immediate needs such as household duties rather than long-term things such as the financial future of the household 🏠</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, there&rsquo;s the reality of the gender pay gap. It means that women accumulate less wealth over time than men, and also that they have less money available out of their budget that they can invest on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>What can we do to change this?</h4>\n\n<p>The gender pay gap will unfortunately not be closed from one day to the next &ndash; but even with the &lsquo;mental load&rsquo; that some women carry, there are ways to get started investing as soon as today! 💰</p>\n\n<p>1️⃣ Plan to make investing a habit. You can invest a certain percentage of your income each month or, if your finances are not quite sufficient, even as little as $10 per month. The most important thing is to start researching regularly and make investing a habit 👌</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26658070/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26658070/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>2️⃣ Social trading, or, as its subcategory is called: Copy Trading. This is basically online investing where you copy the habits of a few popular investors. You should still do your own research and make independent decisions, of course, but taking inspiration from what other successful investors are doing is an easy way to spot current trends.</p>\n\n<p>3️⃣ If you are a woman who is already investing, tell your friends to join you! Motivating people in your network to slowly get into investing and making it a topic of conversation in your everyday life will introduce you to new ideas and make investing fun 🤠 Moreover, it will empower the women around you to take charge of their financial future and make an impact on the world around them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>S</strong><strong>o does that then mean that women are better at investing than men?</strong>&nbsp;No &ndash; in short, no one gender is necessarily definitively better at investing than the other 😇 But knowing that&nbsp;<em><strong>1)</strong></em>&nbsp;women face more hurdles in getting into the investment game than men and that&nbsp;<em><strong>2)</strong></em>&nbsp;women tend to invest more impactfully, it is worth thinking about how women can feel empowered to start investing 💪</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, go tell your friends &ndash; female or male! &ndash; to get started on their investing journey if they&rsquo;ve not already joined you. Be the movement &ndash; make impact 💓</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26658117/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26658117/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n","a_creation":"25/07/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

Always make sure to do your own research beforehand.</p>\n\n<p>One key element is understanding where the business makes the most money. 💰 For example, do you know Amazon&rsquo;s main revenue driver? You should also think about the company&#39;s future! A company may look interesting now, but will it still make profits in 10 years? ⏳ Once you feel confident that a stock is both likely to increase in value and also matches your beliefs, feel free to invest away.</p>\n\n<h4>🙅&zwj;♀️&nbsp;<strong>DON&rsquo;T let your emotions interfere!</strong></h4>\n\n<p>Investing should be done on a rational basis. As people, we&rsquo;re emotionally driven, ❤️ and while emotions help us make decisions, they should not play a part in deciding to invest in a company or not. You may be extremely excited about a company, but if it has bad financials, it may face bankruptcy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One good example is FOMO (= in the sense of investing). 🤑 Many investors tend to sell their stocks as soon as they have made a good return, but, it would probably be more profitable for them to hold on to such good investments even longer!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26658549/giphy1.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26658549/giphy1.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>FOMO works the other way around, too: Many investors tend to hold on to their bad investments forever instead of selling as soon as their performance deteriorates. 📉 Investing in better stocks would then be an option instead.</p>\n\n<h4>✔️ DO make sure your portfolio is diversified!</h4>\n\n<p>Many investors choose to diversify their portfolios since it allows them to minimize the company-specific risk and therefore the overall risk of their portfolio. 💼 However, you should not think that simply by buying different assets classes, you will be making your portfolio bulletproof against any downturns.</p>\n\n<p>Holding different stocks may protect you from one company&#39;s stock decreasing but not if the whole stock market decreases. Bonds, for example, are a good diversifier if the interest rates go up (bonds value increase, stocks decrease) &ndash; but what if there&rsquo;s a financial crisis? 🤯 You can add many more asset classes such as real estate, art, crypto assets, and many more. 🖼 The risk of a decrease in value of your portfolio will thus minimize (but never be at zero!).</p>\n\n<h4>🙅&zwj;♂️ DON&rsquo;T attempt to time the market!</h4>\n\n<p>It sounds like the easiest play: When the stock prices within a certain sector or even for the market in its entirety are low, and you have a good gut feeling about future prospects of a company, you want to buy its stock now before the price increases. Meaning you&rsquo;ll make a big profit. 💸😇</p>\n\n<p>Yet, you might want to take another moment to think it over! ✋ Market trends can be extremely hard to predict and depend on numerous factors such as the emergence of a new technology, a change in the regulatory environment amongst other policy changes. 📝&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To make things even more complicated, there are unprecedented events that are impossible to forecast. For example, think of Christiano Ronaldo moving his coke bottle out of the picture during a press meeting at the 2020 Euro Football Championships ⚽️ &ndash; the market value of the Coca-Cola stock decreased by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cristiano-ronaldo-coca-cola-market-value-loss/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>$4 billion</u></a>!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26658669/giphy2.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26658669/giphy2.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Historically, the market is likely to increase over time &ndash; it&rsquo;s just a matter of time. ⏰ Up until now, every market index has recovered from its many falls. So make sure to stick to your financial goals! Impact investing is a long-term strategy rather than short-term trading, and that&rsquo;s why attempting to time the market might be hurtful. 💔</p>\n\n<h4>🙅&zwj;♀️ DON&rsquo;T excessively check your investments!</h4>\n\n<p>Imagine you&rsquo;ve just bought a new stock from a business you&rsquo;ve been excited about for a while and finally made a decision to invest in &ndash; it&rsquo;s tempting to check in every couple of minutes to see how it&rsquo;s doing. 👀 Don&rsquo;t drive yourself crazy and start doubting if the stocks decrease a bit after you bought it, though! You are investing with long-term goals, and your investments are likely to increase in the long run. It&rsquo;s all about patience! ✌️ Whereas the market might fluctuate, you will see the growth of your investment in the long run.</p>\n\n<h4>All in all ...&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>Be aware of your own biases, try to follow some of the above advice, and allow yourself to trust in your own analysis and research &ndash; that already makes you a better investor! 🤲🌍 So what are you waiting for? Go find some investments that make an impact on the world and apply them to your financial goals.</p>\n\n<p>Be the movement &ndash; make!mpact 💞</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26658704/photo-1527347757911-56639bbfa470.jpg?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26658704/photo-1527347757911-56639bbfa470.jpg?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n","a_creation":"27/07/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

You probably won&rsquo;t be surprised that this the case for finance, as well! 💰</p>\n\n<p>For example, in the US, people of color pay consistently more in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://inequality.org/facts/racial-inequality/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>student loans</u></a>, and white people are<a href=\"https://inequality.org/facts/racial-inequality/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;<u>approx. 27%</u></a>&nbsp;more likely to be homeowners than people of color. All of this is to say: Certain financial barriers exist for people of color simply because of their race. ⚖️</p>\n\n<h4>But how does racial justice even relate to investing?&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>While it might seem difficult, there are many ways through which your investments can directly or indirectly support racial justice. So if you&rsquo;re interested in supporting communities of color through your investments, now&rsquo;s the time to listen up. 📣</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here are four different ways to start investing in racial justice:</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26659474/giphy__23_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>\n\n<h4>1️⃣ Supporting businesses owned by people of color&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>While this of course can also be done by everyday actions such as buying your next vacation read or winter sweater, you can also decide to invest in businesses owned by people of color. 🏦</p>\n\n<p>While executives of the biggest publicly listed companies tend to be white men, you&rsquo;ll find that companies owned and run by people of color are more likely to be small or midsize. 🌱 In the meantime, smaller companies tend to outperform average large companies in the long run.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, if you research thoroughly, you may be able to spot&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/invest-racial-justice-2?trk=hub_featured_content&amp;trk_channel=web&amp;trk_element=hyperlink&amp;trk_elementPosition=1&amp;trk_location=FeaturedContent&amp;trk_sectionCategory=hub_featured_content&amp;trk_copy=6%20Ways%20Your%20Investments%20Can%20Fund%20Racial%20Justice\" target=\"_blank\"><u>small companies that have promising growth potential</u></a>&nbsp;and are also run by people of color. 💪💸 Such an investment would be making an impact!</p>\n\n<h4>2️⃣ Buying into funds with a racial justice filter</h4>\n\n<p>Currently, there are not too many of these on the market. In fact,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/racial-justice-investing-5111992\" target=\"_blank\"><u>as of February 2021, there&rsquo;s only one</u></a>: the Impact Shares NAACP Minority Empowerment ETF (NACP). 🗂 It tracks the Morningstar Minority Empowerment Index and focuses on companies that meet the guidelines of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Some of its top holdings include Apple, Microsoft, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Visa, and Disney. 📊</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26659439/giphy__22_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>\n\n<p>Apart from this ETF, you might also want to look into some funds focusing on specific ESG criteria and track how they are doing on racial justice.</p>\n\n<h4>3️⃣ Supporting businesses that incorporate racial diversity&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>Many studies have proven that, from a business management perspective, more diverse teams lead to more creative solutions, and, in the end, more profit for the company. 🎨💡 Investing in diverse companies could therefore be setting yourself up for good returns.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>When doing your research, do however be aware to check for people of color in all levels of leadership positions. 🗳👩🏽&zwj;💼 &lsquo;Diversity&rsquo; is sometimes still promoted when people of color are leading only from the very bottom of an organization instead of across it.</p>\n\n<h4>4️⃣ Recognizing that investments, just like the SDGs, can create a domino effect of change&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>Once you trigger one element of impact, more will likely follow. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important to do your research! 📚 Here&rsquo;s two examples from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ellevest.com/magazine/investing/invest-racial-justice\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Ellevest</u></a>&nbsp;that you might like to incorporate into your investing knowledge:</p>\n\n<p>👉&nbsp;<strong>Unhealthy food and beverages:</strong>&nbsp;Companies who make their living by selling such products usually spend lots of money on targeting low-income, often non-white communities. 🍔🥤 It leads to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ellevest.com/magazine/investing/invest-racial-justice\" target=\"_blank\"><u>increased health issues for people of color</u></a>&nbsp;and has a particular impact on the children in this community.</p>\n\n<p>👉&nbsp;<strong>Fossil fuels:</strong>&nbsp;People of color are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ellevest.com/magazine/investing/invest-racial-justice\" target=\"_blank\"><u>more likely to die from climate-change-related conditions</u>&nbsp;</a>such as air pollution. 🏭😷 The fossil fuels that are released in the supply chain of a product might therefore have a damaging impact on non-white communities.</p>\n\n<p>These two examples basically show that by investing in companies that do not release fossil fuels or companies that support human health, it&rsquo;s likely that by investing in those companies, you are somehow fighting against racial injustice. ✊🏾 It&rsquo;s all one big domino game and if you do your research well, maybe you can target the domino piece that will make multiple others fall. 🎯</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26659417/giphy__21_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>\n\n<h4>And the takeaways?&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>Investing for your own financial gain while supporting racial justice is more than possible. And hey! By investing in companies that support racial justice in one way or another, you are letting the market know that you, as a consumer, are interested in promoting diversity, equity, and justice. ⚖️🤸&zwj;♂️ Both money and information are powerful tools when it comes to investing. We hope that this article has given you a hint or two on how to start investing with impact. 💸🌱</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26659576/james-eades-y1ms-h50FMA-unsplash__1_.jpg?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>\n","a_creation":"29/07/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

This ratio expresses how much we&rsquo;re paying for each 1&euro; of EPS.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Think about Amazon and eBay &ndash; both offer a relatively similar online market platform but vary significantly in their P/E ratio ⚖️:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n        <li>\n        <p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/key-statistics?p=AMZN\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Amazon</u>:</a>&nbsp;70.75&nbsp;</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n        <p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EBAY/key-statistics?p=EBAY\" target=\"_blank\"><u>eBay</u>:</a>&nbsp;16.7.&nbsp;</p>\n        </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These two companies are therefore trading at values of 70x and 16x of earnings respectively, which signals that Amazon is valued much higher than eBay 😲</p>\n\n<p>This already gives us a great impression of how multiples can be used by investors: they act as instruments to compare similar companies in order to spot the most profitable investment opportunities 😏💫</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26661208/giphy3.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26661208/giphy3.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Stocks with very high multiples may be overvalued, just as stocks with very low multiples may represent undervalued stocks and potentially great investment opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>The multiples to remember 💡</h4>\n\n<p>There are generally two categories of multiples: 1️⃣&nbsp;<strong>Enterprise value (EV)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>multiples</strong>, and 2️⃣&nbsp;<strong>Equity</strong>&nbsp;<strong>multiples</strong>. For the first category, under which EV is calculated as Equity + Debt - Cash, the following key multiples exist:</p>\n\n<p>👉&nbsp;EV/Revenues</p>\n\n<p>👉 EV/EBIT (Earnings before Interest and Tax)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>👉 EV/EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>EV multiples&nbsp;</strong>generally have the advantage that the whole capital structure is taken into account. This means that EV multiples are super useful if your chosen company has a very different capital structure from other comparable companies 🎯Just imagine trying to evaluate a company with very little debt if all your comparable companies were drowning in loans 🥵</p>\n\n<p><strong>For Equity multiples</strong>, which usually have the share price &lsquo;P&rsquo; as the numerator, the following multiples are frequently used:</p>\n\n<p>👉 P/E</p>\n\n<p>👉 Price-to-Book ratio (P/B) (&lsquo;Book&rsquo; refers to a company&rsquo;s book value of all assets)</p>\n\n<p>👉 Price-to-Sales (P/S)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Beware</strong>❗️In case any Earnings metric (EBIT, EBITDA) should be negative, switching to Multiples with &lsquo;Sales&rsquo; or &lsquo;Revenues&rsquo; as the denominator is the way to go &ndash; it allows you to avoid negative Multiples 🎉</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26661181/giphy3.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26661181/giphy3.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>The Multiples Approach&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve got the basics covered, let&rsquo;s dive deeper into where else multiples can be applied. Most importantly, they are used as a valuation tool dubbed the&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;Multiples Approach&rsquo; (MA)</strong>, in order to calculate the enterprise or equity value of a specific company 👨&zwj;💻💰&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>How does that work?</p>\n\n<p>The Multiples Approach is based on the idea that shares of similar companies should also be valued similarly 🙌 That&#39;s why it&#39;s also often called<strong>&nbsp;&lsquo;comparables analysis&rsquo;</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The basic idea is that you take an average of a specific multiple for all the companies which are comparable to the one that you are investigating, and then use that multiple to calculate your desired company value 🔥 But let&#39;s go through this step-by-step:</p>\n\n<h4>1️⃣ Selection of comparables</h4>\n\n<p>After choosing which company you want to evaluate, find the most fitting comparable companies. This is super important as these comparables alone are basically used to value the chosen company 💡 You should consider that a small, but meaningful group of comparables will yield much better results than a broad industry sample.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/valuation/how-to-choose-comparable-companies/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Key criteria</u></a>&nbsp;to find comparables are industry classification, geography, size, growth, and profitability 💥</p>\n\n<h4>For example &hellip;</h4>\n\n<p>Think of Lufthansa, Germany&rsquo;s flagship carrier and the largest European airline by revenue: with the majority of operations and flights in Europe, a comparable company should not only be another airline with a similar business model but also one operating primarily within Europe 🛫🇪🇺 Additionally, comparables should have a similar size to Lufthansa in terms of revenues, and they should follow a similar profitability path.</p>\n\n<p>In this context, AirFrance-KLM and IAG (which comprises the airlines British Airways and Iberia) serve as great comparables 😇 In contrast, low-cost carriers such as EasyJet and Ryanair might be less suitable, due to their low-cost business model which, for the latter, has resulted in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://centreforaviation.com/analysis/reports/ryanairs-fy2019-results-a-warning-to-europes-airlines-474311\" target=\"_blank\"><u>margins much higher than Lufthansa&rsquo;s</u></a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26661316/giphy4.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26661316/giphy4.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>2️⃣ Valuation</h4>\n\n<p>The first step is to choose a fitting multiple based on the explanations above 📊 Subsequently, you calculate the average of your chosen multiple over the selection of comparables. Finally, that average is multiplied with the respective denominator metric for your company.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>For example &hellip;</h4>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s get back to Lufthansa! ✈️ After key competitors have been identified and a specific multiple chosen (e.g. EV/Revenues), this multiple is averaged over all comparables. Then, that average is multiplied with Lufthansa&rsquo;s revenues from last year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>And, voil&agrave;</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; you&rsquo;ve valued your very first company by calculating its enterprise value! 🤩 Not too bad, huh? We hope that this allows you to make some well-informed investment decisions based not just on a company&rsquo;s sustainability mission but also it&rsquo;s financials. So go be the movement &ndash; make!mpact 🤲❣️</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26661028/photo-1558882423-f05f3544bebc.jpg?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26661028/photo-1558882423-f05f3544bebc.jpg?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n","a_creation":"01/08/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

In today&#39;s first edition, we&rsquo;ll start with&nbsp;<strong>Beyond Meat</strong>&nbsp;🥩🌱 You may have heard plenty about their burgers, but do you know anything about their footprint, impact or financial situation? No worries, after having read this article you&rsquo;ll be up to date! 📅</p>\n\n<p>But why is the meatless industry of relevance? Most will have a straightforward answer to this &ndash; it&rsquo;s better for the environment. And, indeed, livestock 🐮🐷 is a major contributor to many environmental issues, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, soil erosion, extensive use of land, and high water usage. Besides, plant-based meat is healthier and could reduce obesity 🥦 The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research/future-of-meat-industrial-farming/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>shift towards the meatless industry</u></a>&nbsp;is also fostered by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/04/animal-agriculture-choking-earth-making-sick-climate-food-environmental-impact-james-cameron-suzy-amis-cameron\" target=\"_blank\"><u>several scandals</u></a>, such as working conditions and the ethical treatment of animals.</p>\n\n<p>So, let&rsquo;s have a look at Beyond Meat, a producer of plant-based meat alternatives founded in the US in 2009 by Ethan Brown 🇺🇸 Having cooperated and sold their products in supermarkets, the company now has several products on the market and partnerships with some of the world&rsquo;s biggest food chains, including McDonald&rsquo;s, Taco Bell and many more 🍔🌮 With its current share price of 124 USD, the company is valued at $7.94 billion.</p>\n\n<h4>Sustainable Development Goals</h4>\n\n<p>Beyond Meat&rsquo;s mission is to shift people&rsquo;s meat consumption to more sustainable, plant-based alternatives 😋🥗 By doing so, the company itself claims to tackle the following four key issues: human health, climate change, constraints on natural resources, and animal welfare.</p>\n\n<p>Four SDGs emerge amongst the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bluehorizon.com/beyond-meat-2/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>most important impact areas for Beyond Meat</u></a>&nbsp;👉 SDG 3, 12, 13, and 15. Let&rsquo;s have a look at each of them individually:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26870785/Screen_Shot_2021-07-28_at_13.01.06.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26870785/Screen_Shot_2021-07-28_at_13.01.06.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Good Health and Wellbeing</strong></p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve heard it all before: excessive meat consumption is bad for our health 🥵&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/112/5/1188/5890315?login=true\" target=\"_blank\"><u>In a recent study conducted at Stanford University</u></a>, researchers evaluated the impact of replacing animal-based meat with plant-based alternatives such as Beyond Meat. The results are clear: substitution to plant-based alternatives significantly improved participants&rsquo; health, as measured by the three categories: 1️⃣ cholesterol level, 2️⃣ heart disease risk factors, and 3️⃣ bodyweight.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Responsible Production and Consumption</strong></p>\n\n<p>Our current diets promote the seemingly infinite growth of meat production and consumption 📈 This is also channeled through media and publicity, which still to date deceive and encourage us into further consumption. Production will only decrease if we as individuals change our behavior substantially, consume in moderation, and thus reduce our meat demand overall 🙌 This is where Beyond Meat steps in: through their plant-based offerings, they provide us with a sensible alternative for more responsible consumption 🕺</p>\n\n<p><strong>Climate Action</strong></p>\n\n<p>Grazed animals are the largest source of methane emissions &ndash; and, so, the consumption of sustainable diets such as those based on vegetables, grains, nuts and seeds, presents important opportunities to reduce GHG emissions 🥕🥜🙋&zwj;♀️&nbsp;<a href=\"https://css.umich.edu/sites/default/files/publication/CSS18-10.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>A recent study from the University of Michigan</u></a>&nbsp;has confirmed this viewpoint by conducting a life-cycle analysis of beef vs. plant-based burger patties. Results pointed towards a GHG emission reduction of 90% when substituting beef with the far-more-sustainable pea protein 👏</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26882201/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26882201/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Additionally, animal grazing significantly contributes to the world&rsquo;s deforestation 😰 since it accounts for 70% of agricultural land. Imagine if we could convert that land back to grassland and forests! It&rsquo;s a dream that may one day become reality: the above-mentioned study estimates that plant-based patties have 93% less impact on land use than beef patties 🌳🙏</p>\n\n<p><strong>Life on Land</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the past decades, global biodiversity has gradually decreased 🐛↘️ By means of animal grazing, the meat industry has indirectly contributed to this. This is because grazing prevents the conservation and revegetation of lands which are considered most effective in slowing biodiversity loss. In this way, companies producing meat alternatives indirectly contribute to slowing biodiversity loss 🤲🐯 as animal grazing is avoided entirely.</p>\n\n<h4>ESG Risks</h4>\n\n<p>So far, Beyond Meat showed a positive impact in many areas &ndash; but all that glitters is not gold ⛔ Let&rsquo;s have a more detailed drill-down of ESG Risks in accordance with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://materiality.sasb.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>SASB Materiality Map</u></a>. It identifies the biggest ESG-related issues which are likely to affect the financials and operations of companies of a specific industry 🏗</p>\n\n<p><strong>Environmental risks</strong></p>\n\n<p>Despite significantly reducing GHG emissions in comparison to beef patties, Beyond Meat&rsquo;s burgers are still packed in plastic and use cardboard, which both require loads of energy and resources (11% of total emissions, 21% of total energy use, 14% of total water use) 🔌💦 Why not use recycled materials? 🧐</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26882267/giphy__25_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26882267/giphy__25_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Moreover,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sustainablereview.com/is-beyond-meat-sustainable/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>a sustainable supply chain is much more important</u></a>&nbsp;than organic farming. True: organic farming limits the use of fertilizers and other chemicals 🧪 But in the case of Beyond Meat, the main ingredient is peas. Sourcing this ingredient in a sustainable way, i.e. without much land destruction or large crop failures, and under good and ethical working conditions 👨&zwj;🌾☀️ weighs more than the use of pesticides.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Social risks</strong></p>\n\n<p>Health-related issues have revolved around Beyond Meat&rsquo;s burgers. Classified as &ldquo;ultra-processed food&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://sustainablereview.com/is-beyond-meat-sustainable/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>FAO, Noval Classification Scheme</u></a>), the burger contains a large number of ingredients and requires a thorough manufacturing process ⏰ A recent study has even discovered that one of the burger&rsquo;s many ingredients was in fact&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ezineblog.org/2020/12/12/beyond-meat-fails-the-test-again-too-much-mineral-oil/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>residual mineral oil</u></a>&nbsp;⛰&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Another social risk factor is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21366607/beyond-impossible-plant-based-meat-factory-farming\" target=\"_blank\"><u>product affordability</u></a>&nbsp;⚖️ Oftentimes, shifting consumer preferences towards more sustainable solutions such as Beyond Meat depends heavily on the price. And not only are Beyond Meat&rsquo;s products significantly more expensive than meat (US: meat $2.80/pound vs. Beyond Meat $6.25/pound) &ndash; they are also priced higher than the majority of other providers of plant-based food 💵</p>\n\n<p>In terms of supply chain management, the sourcing and pricing of pea protein represents the greatest risk and should be researched in more detail before an investment 🚨 For example, the company&rsquo;s main pea suppliers could be analyzed for labor practices, human rights, corruption, and other contract details.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Governmental risks</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Board of Directors takes a large role in the control process of a company by monitoring the behavior of the executive management 👨&zwj;💼👀 In order to fulfill this task, the board should be as independent of the management as possible. Whenever the roles of Board Chairperson and CEO are bundled in one person, company supervision is naturally less independent 😒</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26882295/giphy__26_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26882295/giphy__26_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>At Beyond Meat, the founder Ethan Brown is NOT the board&rsquo;s chairperson &ndash; however, he still sits on the board 💼 And we can all easily envision what kind of power he then holds not only as CEO but also as the founder of the company. Would we dare to disagree with Ethan Brown on important matters if we sat on the Board of Directors? We certainly should! But, in reality, that may be much harder than we think 😬</p>\n\n<p>Beyond Meat also faces transparency risks 🔍 The rating agency S&amp;P Global measures how transparently each company reports on its operational, environmental and climate change risks. Most recent data from 2018 shows that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/beyond-meat-trails-animal-meat-peers-on-reporting-environmental-effects-59477986\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Beyond Meat scores a 0</u></a>&nbsp;(which translates to nothing!),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fooddive.com/news/beyond-meat-lags-conventional-companies-in-sustainability-disclosures-repo/583202/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>while competitors have disclosure rates of 98% or higher</u></a>&nbsp;🤔 Higher disclosure rates do not necessarily translate into &lsquo;more sustainable&rsquo;, but in Beyond Meat&#39;s case, the company&nbsp;<a href=\"https://investors.beyondmeat.com/news-releases/news-release-details/burger-benefits-beyond-meatr-releases-impact-report-quantifying\" target=\"_blank\"><u>does not provide a detailed quantification</u></a>&nbsp;of its GHG emissions, nor does it publish a comprehensive sustainability report 🤷&zwj;♂️</p>\n\n<h4>Financials</h4>\n\n<p>Now having seen the ESG risks associated with Beyond Meat, it&rsquo;s time to dive deeper into the financials of the company 🏦</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/36991893/1648029140121.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/36991893/1648029140121.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/36992022/1648029343318.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/36992022/1648029343318.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Revenue has been increasing tremendously over the last few years 💅 From only $16 million in 2016, annual revenue increased to $407 million in 2020 and is expected to rise to $2.09 billion in 2025.

This impactful viewpoint is shared by many investors 💸 who value the company at a significant premium compared to its key competitors, in spite of negative financial profits in the past ❗️ Additional risks such as lower product affordability, close alignment between supervision and management of the company and lack of transparency must be taken into account before an investment.</p>\n","a_creation":"03/08/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

These range from energy generation and storage 📦 to transport 🚚 and recycling. Companies that develop specialized solutions for water treatment, cleaner air or more sustainable agriculture also fall under Cleantech.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A characteristic of Cleantech is that it is often very asset-intensive 💼 and relies on large investment tickets, making it more difficult to scale (compared to Climate Tech).</p>\n\n<p>Several trends can be observed within the Cleantech market. Most of them are not necessarily new inventions &ndash; take wind energy 🪁 and electric vehicles, for example &ndash; but new developments make their use much more affordable 🙌 Technological advancements are creating new opportunities for further innovation and opening up the market for widespread adoption in large-scale projects and in private homes. The sector is forecast to grow globally to $2.5 trillion by 2022 🔥</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26882822/giphy__28_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26882822/giphy__28_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>At a first glance, Climate Tech seems very similar to Cleantech, but it differs in the details 🔍 Climate Tech is defined by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/sustainability/assets/pwc-the-state-of-climate-tech-2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>PWC</u></a>&nbsp;as &quot;a broad set of sectors tackling the challenge of decarbonizing the global economy, with the aim of achieving net-zero emissions before 2050&quot;. These sectors include easily scalable companies engaged in carbon capture and storage and better carbon management (improving transparency and accounting) 💡🗄 Famous examples are multi-billion companies like Tesla, Beyond Meat and Nest.</p>\n\n<p>Pale Blue Dot, a specialized Climate Tech Venture Capital fund,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/pale-blue-dot-vc/what-is-climate-tech-715cab6853f8\" target=\"_blank\"><u>distinguishes three different categories</u></a>&nbsp;within the sector:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>1️⃣&nbsp;<strong>Reduce:</strong>&nbsp;this category includes all products and technologies that incrementally increase and improve our current status quo (increasing energy efficiency or minimizing waste) 😎&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>2️⃣&nbsp;<strong>Reverse:</strong>&nbsp;this is associated with more radical change and focuses on removing carbon from the atmosphere through carbon capture or reforestation 🌲</p>\n\n<p>3️⃣&nbsp;<strong>Preparing for a new world:</strong>&nbsp;this is about trying to develop technologies to help deal with the impacts of climate change such as weather disasters 🌪 and food and water security.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A 2020<a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/sustainability/assets/pwc-the-state-of-climate-tech-2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;<u>study by PwC</u></a>&nbsp;concluded that venture capital investment in Climate Tech will total $16.1 billion in 2019, a 3750% increase since 2013.

Maybe you have not only enjoyed their oat drink in one of your most recent coffees ☕️ but were also aware of their commitment towards a more sustainable and transparent food industry. Or, did you possibly stumble upon one of their bold marketing campaigns, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oatly.com/uk/ditch-milk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>this one</u></a>? ↘️</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26883461/cjtihr46007z8rbqrvdb6v2nj-oatly-ditchmilk-banner.larger.jpg?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26883461/cjtihr46007z8rbqrvdb6v2nj-oatly-ditchmilk-banner.larger.jpg?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>But enough of the fun facts &ndash; let&rsquo;s get to it! 👊</p>\n\n<p>Oatly Group AB was founded in 1994 and is headquartered in Malm&ouml;, Sweden 🇸🇪 It focuses on the development of oat-based products such as milk, yogurt, cream and ice cream 🍦 Since going public in 2021, Oatly is the only other listed company after&nbsp;<a href=\"https://club.makeimpact.io/posts/scheduled/beyond-meat-beat-the-meat-%F0%9F%A5%A9%F0%9F%8C%B1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Beyond Meat</u></a>&nbsp;to only develop plant-based products.</p>\n\n<p>So, what are the reasons behind the growth of the plant-based food and beverage industry? 🧐🌱 For example, just in the US, plant-based foods were responsible for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gfi.org/marketresearch/#categories\" target=\"_blank\"><u>sales volume of $7 billion USD</u>!</a>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s a 43% increase over the last two years 💰 And guess what item contributed the most? You got it &ndash; plant-based dairy substitutes, comprising approximately one-third of total sales.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Now, back to the question at hand: why are people so caught up in oats? 🌾 For starters, many people abandon dairy milk due to lactose intolerance. Beyond that, however, one of the key reasons to embrace Oatly&rsquo;s products lies in the fact that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:b0b53649-5e93-4415-bf07-6b0b1227172f\" target=\"_blank\"><u>plant-based drinks emit only around one third of the GHGs dairy milk does</u></a>&nbsp;🙌 As for land use, dairy milk requires ten times as much agricultural space as plant-based alternatives!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26883586/giphy_30.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26883586/giphy_30.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h2>Sustainable Development Goals</h2>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s ask the important question: where does Oatly specifically create the most impact? 💥&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sustainability.oatly.com/hi-oat-fans/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Oatly itself</u></a>&nbsp;declares that it &ldquo;aims to drive a systematic shift toward a sustainable, resilient food system that empowers people to choose solutions that improve their lives and ensure the future of the planet for generations to come.&rdquo; 🌏 As such, the following SDGs emerge as the most important ones for the company:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26883632/Screen_Shot_2021-07-28_at_19.22.29.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26883632/Screen_Shot_2021-07-28_at_19.22.29.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>SDG 2: Zero hunger 🍜</h4>\n\n<p>Oatly is cooperating with NGOs and research bodies to continually improve sustainable farming methods. Additionally,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sustainability.oatly.com/ingredients/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>since 87% of total purchase volumes</u></a>&nbsp;trace back to oats, Oatly relies to a large extent on oat farmers 👩&zwj;🌾 To develop sustainable and long-term supplier relationships, Oatly is only cooperating with oat farmers who have previously passed a thorough evaluation 🔍 Among other factors, suppliers have to prove that they are socially sustainable (e.g. no corruption, high safety regulations) and environmentally sustainable 🍃 (e.g. no usage of growth regulators or glyphosate, certified production methods).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being 👩&zwj;⚕️</h4>\n\n<p>Oatly particularly claims to help achieve target 3.4, relating to the reduction in the number of deaths caused by non-communicable diseases (e.g. heart attacks, diabetes) 💔 Among others,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oatly.com/uploads/attachments/cjumfa3lz3xjheuqrbfkzep7q-2sidedfactsheet-uk-201904-web.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Oatly&rsquo;s products contain less saturated fat</u></a>&nbsp;than dairy milk 🥛 This type of fat is, on average, overconsumed and associated with a higher risk of non-communicable diseases. In contrast, fiber 🌾 which is underconsumed compared to its recommended dose, is included in Oatly&rsquo;s products to a larger extent than in dairy milk.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26883696/giphy__30_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26883696/giphy__30_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth 📈</h4>\n\n<p>Oatly is committed to creating equal-pay employment ⚖️, safe working conditions and established worker rights. As the company keeps growing into the US and Asia, Oatly globally implements its internal Code of Conduct in an attempt to create equal conditions for ALL employees 💖&nbsp;<a href=\"https://investors.oatly.com/static-files/12b5fff3-1abc-427b-9465-e7a72bcddc22\" target=\"_blank\"><u>In terms of gender equality</u></a>, male and female employees both comprise around half of the total employees AND team management positions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production 🏗</h4>\n\n<p>By advocating for healthier, more sustainable diets through its role as an external communicator, Oatly is particularly contributing towards target 12.8. The company plays a public role in media with several awareness-raising ads 📰 and appearances at panel discussions, but also through interaction with governments, as demonstrated by the &ldquo;German Petition&rdquo; ✊ This petition was Oatly&rsquo;s campaign to make climate footprint declarations mandatory for companies in Germany &ndash; through which it gathered more than 50,000 signatures 🥳</p>\n\n<h4>SDG 13: Climate Change 🌏🥵</h4>\n\n<p>Climate change is probably Oatly&rsquo;s biggest impact area. Most importantly, a life cycle analysis conducted in 2013 concluded that by substituting dairy milk with an oat-based drink,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zaailingen.com/wp-content/bestanden/oatly.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>GHG emissions, land use and energy consumption would be reduced by 80%, 79% and 60%, respectively</u></a>&nbsp;🌟Despite the fact that this study would have yielded less extreme numbers if the dairy farms in question had been organic, it appears that Oatly still has a significant impact within SDG 13.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, one of Oatly&rsquo;s major achievements is the precise&nbsp;<a href=\"https://investors.oatly.com/static-files/12b5fff3-1abc-427b-9465-e7a72bcddc22\" target=\"_blank\"><u>quantification of the climate footprints of 132 products</u></a>&nbsp;👣💚 Overall, the company has demanded that the entire food industry be more transparent about their products&rsquo; footprint. With all these efforts, the company is a key impactor towards achieving target 13.3 of increasing knowledge and capacity to better cope with climate change 🧠</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26883743/giphy__31_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26883743/giphy__31_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h2>ESG risks</h2>\n\n<h4>The E</h4>\n\n<p>Oatly itself has come to a very crucial realisation: quickly and flexibly adapting to sky-rocketing demand may come at the expense of environmental impact 😳 For example, the single largest carbon-driver for the company was transportation 🚛 And, in recently entering the Asian market, the company has thus far relied on transporting products solely via aircraft. As a consequence, despite Asia comprising only a margin of total revenues, the distribution to the continent accounted for 52% of Oatly&rsquo;s total CO2 emitted through transportation ✈️💨</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the proportion of renewable energy used went down from 62% in 2019 to 49% in 2020, resulting in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oatly.com/uploads/attachments/ckqv4y5xd001f9xgil61zhso2-oatly-sustainability-report-2021-web.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>35% increase in climate impact from energy usage</u></a>&nbsp;😒 One of the main drivers behind this change was that new production plants in the Netherlands and the United States run on fossil fuels 🏭&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>The S</h4>\n\n<p>Currently, social risks are limited. You could, however, point out that future emphasis should be on corruption, or safe working conditions, as Oatly is expanding further into less developed countries outside of Europe and North America 🌏</p>\n\n<h4>The G</h4>\n\n<p>There are quite a few risks in this category, so, for overview, we will split them up into a few key issues:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Transparency&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>For starters, there are not many companies in the food and beverage industry that report as thoroughly on the carbon footprint of their products as Oatly does 📝</p>\n\n<p>However, more reporting does not ALWAYS mean more transparency. For example, as pointed out in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sprucepointcap.com/oatly-group-ab/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>recent report from investment management firm Spruce Point Capital Management</u></a>, Oatly allegedly hides the fact that oat drink has substantially&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zaailingen.com/wp-content/bestanden/oatly.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>higher water usage</u></a>&nbsp;🚰 than dairy milk by simply cherry-picking the metrics that paint the most rosy picture 😟</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26884012/giphy__32_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/26884012/giphy__32_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Accounting</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>The same report alludes to serious accounting issues at Oatly 🧮 Most importantly, revenues are claimed to be overstated, as there is a noticeable deviation between the historical growth in revenues and accounts receivables. On top of that, the gross margin calculation of Oatly does not include outbound shipping and handling costs 🏗 Both factors would decrease the margin, particularly considering that outbound shipping costs are currently increasing with Oatly&rsquo;s expansion into Asia ↗️</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Ownership</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>In 2020, Oatly sold a $200m stake to the private equity firm Blackstone 🗄 While there is nothing wrong with that per se, the ownership transfer is among the most consequential governance-related risks for Oatly. Why? 🤔</p>\n\n<p>Blackstone fundamentally violates many of the values that Oatly&rsquo;s key consumers stand for and which Oatly is marketing itself towards 💣 For example, Blackstone previously held investments in a Brazilian infrastructure company linked to the deforestation of the Amazonian rainforest 🌳🕳🧹 Blackstone&rsquo;s co-founder has also donated towards the political campaigns of Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell, both frequently accused of fraudulent and corrupt behaviour.</p>\n\n<h2>Financials</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/36992871/1648030949084.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/36992871/1648030949084.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/36992900/1648030979565.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/36992900/1648030979565.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Oatly&rsquo;s financials have been characterised by red numbers over the previous years 📕 In fact, the &ldquo;history of losses and inability to achieve or sustain profitability&rdquo; has been cited as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1843586/000119312521121323/d123209df1.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the company&rsquo;s number one business risk by Oatly itself</u></a>&nbsp;❗️ In 2020, despite an impressive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oatly.com/uploads/attachments/ckqv4y5xd001f9xgil61zhso2-oatly-sustainability-report-2021-web.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">106.5% revenue growth</a>&nbsp;and the emergence as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://investors.oatly.com/static-files/0bfad979-62b9-4d3d-84aa-6b112ee5c41b\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the top oat-product brand in Europe, North America and Asia</u></a>, total expenses increased significantly, resulting in a negative EBIT and profit margin 😬&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/36992822/1648030873806.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/36992822/1648030873806.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, Oatly is outperforming all its competitors with an extremely high valuation 🤷&zwj;♂️ A multiple comparison yields multiples exceeding values of 20 while competitors score values below 5.

But are you familiar with all the different types of crowdfunding that are out there? No worries, we&rsquo;ve got you on this one! 💪</p>\n\n<h2>Crowdfunding: what is it and how does it work?</h2>\n\n<p>Crowdfunding is a way of collectively sourcing capital, mainly for startups and projects, but also for more developed companies. Through many small contributions, it allows for financing means outside institutional circuits 🏦 and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a popular choice for funding up-and-coming projects.</p>\n\n<p>The operation of crowdfunding is quite simple and based on an online platform 🖥 that connects the fundraisers to the crowd 💑 It&rsquo;s also here that you&rsquo;ll find all the information you need to evaluate the project and learn what your financial support will go towards.</p>\n\n<p>Good to know 🧐: crowdfunding platforms usually charge fundraisers a fee 💰 in return for the security and visibility that their platforms provide. Often, crowdfunding is also based on an all-or-nothing funding model. This means that you either achieve your goals and receive your crowdfunded means 🎉 or that everyone gets their money back 🤷&zwj;♂️</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27096433/giphy__30_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27096433/giphy__30_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>And now&rsquo;s when things get exciting! You&rsquo;re about to become a connoisseur of all types of crowdfunding 🏆&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>What are the main types of crowdfunding?</h2>\n\n<h4>1) Crowdlending</h4>\n\n<p>Crowdlending is similar to a standard bank loan 🤝💰 There are two main distinctions to be made:&nbsp;<em><strong>1)</strong></em>&nbsp;the peer-to-peer lending, which is basically between individuals and,&nbsp;<em><strong>2)</strong></em>, crowdlending for companies. There are different financial instruments suited for different needs, and can be subdivided into three main subcategories:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>1️⃣&nbsp;<strong>Interest-bearing loans&nbsp;</strong>which means the money you loan will be repaid over a defined term and you will earn a return through the interest 💸 paid on the loan.</p>\n\n<p>2️⃣&nbsp;<strong>Interest-free loans&nbsp;</strong>which are the same as 1️⃣ but without interest.</p>\n\n<p>3️⃣&nbsp;<strong>Mini-bonds</strong>&nbsp;are a kind of debt-securities suited for companies only 👨&zwj;💼 It is similar to a normal loan, but it represents a debt issued by companies. In practice, the debt is in the form of a promissory note, bearer note or a bond and can sometimes be traded on public markets 🛒</p>\n\n<h4>2) Equity crowdfunding</h4>\n\n<p>The investment takes the form of an equity stake in the company 🗂 And it can be:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>1️⃣&nbsp;<strong>In capital&nbsp;</strong>(then you are remunerated in the form of dividends or capital gains from the sale of shares) 💵</p>\n\n<p>2️⃣&nbsp;<strong>In bonds</strong>&nbsp;(then your remuneration takes the form of interest) 📈</p>\n\n<p>3️⃣ In return for&nbsp;<strong>royalties</strong>&nbsp;(and your remuneration takes the form of commissions on turnover) 🏅</p>\n\n<h4>3) Rewards-based crowdfunding</h4>\n\n<p>This crowdfunding model allows the project creator to keep full ownership. The model is based on the individuals&#39; contributions to a project or business in return for a non-financial reward, such as goods or services 👨&zwj;💻</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27096383/giphy__29_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27096383/giphy__29_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>4) Donation-based crowdfunding</h4>\n\n<p>Donation-based crowdfunding rests on the principle of giving without compensation. Funds are raised through donations or sponsorships and used towards charitable projects run by individuals or organisations 🤲💸</p>\n\n<h4>5) Profit-sharing&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>This new kind of crowdfunding built around revenue-sharing contracts may serve the interests of both businesses and investors. It&rsquo;s based on sharing the future profits of enterprises or revenues with the crowd in exchange for immediate funding 💹</p>\n\n<h4>6) Hybrid models</h4>\n\n<p>Finally, this form of crowdfunding offers businesses the opportunity to combine different elements of crowdfunding models 🤹&zwj;♂️ &ndash; for example, one could mix equity and rewards-based crowdfunding.</p>\n\n<h2>Are there risks to crowdfunding? 🤔</h2>\n\n<p>There are probably as many risks to crowdfunding as there are types of crowdfunding. And you should always be aware of these risks &ndash; they&rsquo;re part of the investment game 👻 But clearly risks in crowdfunding are higher than in the stock market (no secondary market, no liquidity, less regulation, no track record) 🤷&zwj;♂️</p>\n\n<p>Also you can be exposed, for example, to scammers who set up attractive projects to dupe naive or first-time investors 😈 Or, management of the invested business or project may have difficulty scaling it which in turn leads to capital erosion rather than wealth creation 🥺</p>\n\n<p>However, this should not keep you from investing via crowdfunding ❗️ There might still be a lot of potential for investing in impactful projects. For example, you might find a great, transparent and believable crowdfunding campaign wherein the gains go towards a business that supports the education of women for the tech industry 👾👩&zwj;💻 In the end, this might speak enough to your values to dare investing in the early game via crowdfunding.</p>\n\n<p>So, as always: beware of risks but don&rsquo;t be afraid to invest where you think you can make an impact 💘</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27096312/giphy__28_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27096312/giphy__28_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n","a_creation":"10/08/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

In the first quarter of 2021,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/content/dam/marketing/emea/uk/Europe_ESG_Q1_2021_Flow_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>European sustainable funds attracted 51% of all investment fund inflows in Europe</u></a>! Additionally, the financial services company MSCI has seen the number of their ESG-related Equity ETFs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.msci.com/www/blog-posts/is-esg-investing-a-price-bubble/02231869256\" target=\"_blank\"><u>increase from 12 in 2014 to an incredible 233 in 2020</u></a>&nbsp;🥳</p>\n\n<p>Sounds great, right?! Not entirely. Naturally, the increased popularity has led to fears of a potential ESG bubble 🎈💥 The (probably) most famous advocate of such a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2021/06/29/esg-bubble-chair-world-largest-pension-fund-japan/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>bubble is Eiji Hirano</u></a>, the former head of the world&rsquo;s largest pension fund, Japan&rsquo;s Government Pension Investment Fund.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In a bubble, an entire industry is overvalued with high prices due to sky-rocketing demand 🚀 and highly-concentrated capital. Since their financial outlooks do not support such high stock prices, the companies&rsquo; valuations would be unjustified ⚖️ It is implied that this bubble will eventually burst, resulting in a sharp devaluation of the overheated market 📉 To sum it up with the words of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.104.6.1467\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Nobel laureate Eugene Farma</u>:</a>&nbsp;a bubble is an &ldquo;irrational strong price increase that implies a predictable strong decline&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<h4>Why we will likely not see an ESG bubble ✅</h4>\n\n<p>Are fears of an ESG bubble justified? The short answer: not really 💁&zwj;♀️ While some specific stocks seem overvalued, the entire industry is certainly not!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>First of all, there is not nearly a sufficient amount of capital in ESG and sustainable investments to tackle the grand challenges of our time ⏰ Thus far, ESG mutual funds and ETF assets globally amount to $4.5 trillion. While this may sound like a lot,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.unepfi.org/climate-change/climate-change/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the UN expects</u></a>&nbsp;that, for the transition towards a low-carbon and resilient economy, investments of at least $60 trillion before 2050 are required 😲</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27095100/giphy__25_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27095100/giphy__25_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, Larry Fink, the CEO of the world&rsquo;s largest asset management firm, BlackRock,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter\" target=\"_blank\"><u>labels the ESG trend as a lasting &ldquo;tectonic shift&rdquo;</u></a>, rather than a temporary bubble 👌 Furthermore, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://coredatainsights.com/beta/na/press-release/1027/coredata-us-press-release-%E2%80%94-esg\" target=\"_blank\"><u>recent study conducted by Core Data Insights</u></a>&nbsp;concluded that ESG is &ldquo;clearly a megatrend that is here to stay&rdquo; 🏆 The majority of participants of the study believed that ALL funds will be incorporating ESG factors within the next five years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, a bubble is argued to be naturally prevented by the current ambiguity revolving around ESG. For example, a fund may label itself as &lsquo;ESG&rsquo;, &lsquo;green&rsquo; or &lsquo;sustainable&rsquo; by simply avoiding the &lsquo;worst-in-class&rsquo; companies 😒, a process called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://club.makeimpact.io/posts/sustainable-investing-thematic-investing-impact-investing-whats-the-difference-%F0%9F%8C%B1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>negative screening</u></a>. This, however, is only one approach to sustainable investing. Alternatively, funds could actively analyse portfolio companies in depth based on custom and specific ESG criteria 💼🌱 Or, they could act as passive ESG funds, simply adjusting weightings based on publicly available ESG scores.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Either way, not only is there a variety of methods on how to set up an ESG fund, there also exist various ESG criteria 📋 Overall, this ambiguity avoids a concentration of capital and, in turn, a bubble, as different ESG funds include different companies🏬🏫&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>The numbers</h4>\n\n<p>The most well-known ESG indices have for long been valued similarly to the broad market, a trend unaffected by the global COVID-19 pandemic. For illustration, the following graph shows various ESG and SRI indices developed by MSCI 📊 They are compared against the benchmark &lsquo;MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI)&rsquo;, which is the broadest index MSCI offers with exposure to companies from all around the globe, covering both developed and emerging countries 🌎</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27094941/1627999240003.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27094941/1627999240003.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" style=\"height:314px; width:514px\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.msci.com/www/blog-posts/is-esg-investing-a-price-bubble/02231869256\" target=\"_blank\"><u>(<em>Source</em>)</u></a></p>\n\n<p>The results seem obvious: there are, to date, no signs of an ESG bubble, as all portrayed ESG indices move in line with the benchmark 👨&zwj;💻 Accordingly, ESG indices typically yield no P/E ratios that exhibit signs of overvaluation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27095712/giphy__26_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27095712/giphy__26_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>There are only a handful of stocks from select industries that do appear overvalued 💰 &ndash; however, they do not affect the valuations of their respective ETFs noticeably. The most &lsquo;bubbly&rsquo; companies to date emerge from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://privatebank.barclays.com/news-and-insights/2021/march/market-perspectives-march-2021/esg-bubble/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>renewable energy, electric vehicle, and waste- and water management industries</u></a>&nbsp;🚗♻️ These are the companies most at risk of being incapable of delivering the financial returns that their valuations suggest. For example, a mini bubble recently burst for the Danish energy company &Oslash;rsted 🇩🇰 who suffered from a significant share price drop after a sharp rise and all-time peak in January 2021 with a P/E ratio above 50!</p>\n\n<h4>So, what should we do?</h4>\n\n<p>First and foremost, we should be aware! 🧐 That is, aware of specific industries and companies which may be overheated due to public interest 🕵️&zwj;♀️🔥 Here, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://club.makeimpact.io/posts/what-are-multiples-and-how-can-we-use-them-%E2%9C%88%EF%B8%8F\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>multiple comparison</u></a>&nbsp;may come in handy to quickly understand how overvalued certain assets are.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The current narrow focus on only a few industries also represents a great opportunity for investors, since certain industries have thus far been neglected 👀 For example, the buildings and construction industry is a major energy-consuming sector and its capital-backed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2020/Apr/IRENA_GRO_Summary_2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>transformation could contribute significantly to lower GHG emissions</u></a>&nbsp;🏗🌆&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We also have to be aware of the growing trend of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://club.makeimpact.io/posts/impact-investing-school-%F0%9F%93%95%F0%9F%8C%B1%F0%9F%8C%8E-greenwashing-%F0%9F%94%8D\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>greenwashing</u></a>! 😳 With surging ESG demand,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thisismatter.com/articles/is-esg-a-bubble\" target=\"_blank\">existing funds have rebranded themselves as ESG funds</a>&nbsp;without changing their investment strategies. Similarly, many newly-established funds often simply label themselves &lsquo;ESG&rsquo; or &lsquo;green&rsquo; without action or further ado 😡 As a result, ESG-labeled funds and their non-ESG counterparts tend to have the identical companies as largest holdings, which raises questions as to how thoroughly and entirely ESG factors have actually been accounted for 🤔</p>\n\n<p>Overall, investors like us should understand ESG as an analysis tool and&nbsp;not&nbsp;simply a &ldquo;name tag&rdquo; for marketing purposes. That way, we can make great investments into companies which&nbsp;actually&nbsp;provide the change we need 💪💖</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27095812/giphy__27_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27095812/giphy__27_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n","a_creation":"12/08/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

Nevertheless, it matters when new compacts on climate change are agreed upon 🗞 In latest news, the EU has renewed its goals for a greener Europe by 2050 by significantly tightening its benchmarks and speeding up the transitional process 🌟 For example, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/delivering-european-green-deal_en\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Green Deal</u></a>&nbsp;declares that the EU should be the world&rsquo;s first climate neutral continent by 2050, and that it pledges to cut its greenhouse gasses emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to the levels of 1990.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, all this may have a few implications for you as an investor 💸 So let&rsquo;s get into the deets of the new EU Green Deal!</p>\n\n<h2>1) Cars 🚘</h2>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a big fact for you: from 2035, all new cars in the EU will have to be zero-emission 🌫🚫 This means a&nbsp;<strong>big</strong>&nbsp;change for the automobile industry &ndash; but seeing that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/the-seven-elements-of-the-eu-green-deal-you-should-care-about\" target=\"_blank\"><u>12% of the EU&rsquo;s carbon emissions are directly traceable to cars</u></a>, such a change might also be necessary 👊</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27439131/giphy__31_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27439131/giphy__31_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Some heavy-lifters in the industry have already committed to a future that follows the EU&rsquo;s regulations. For example, car brand&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/the-seven-elements-of-the-eu-green-deal-you-should-care-about\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Volkswagen</u></a>&nbsp;expects 70% of its car sales to be electric by 2030, while&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210622-audi-to-stop-making-fossil-fuel-cars-by-2033-ceo\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Audi</u></a>&nbsp;will only launch electric car models from 2026 and gradually phase-out their combustion engine until 2033 🇩🇪🔋</p>\n\n<h2>2) Energy efficiency 🔌⚡️</h2>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s now been announced that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/delivering-european-green-deal_en\" target=\"_blank\"><u>40% of the EU&rsquo;s energy is planned to be derived from renewable energy by 2030</u></a>&nbsp;🌬 instead of the 32% that was previously the goal. More efficient use of energy is also being promoted across all sectors. For example, governments will have to renovate 3% of public buildings each year to accommodate energy efficiency, and all buildings in the EU by 2030 should be using 49% renewable energy ♻️</p>\n\n<p>Another thing to be aware of is the Emissions Trading System. This is the part of the Green Deal that basically forces businesses across different sectors to cut down their emission of greenhouse gasses faster than previously planned ⏰ However, moving at a pace faster than planned might come at a price for consumers: for example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/14/eus-green-deal-plans-launched-with-make-or-break-decade-warning\" target=\"_blank\"><u>energy bills are believed to soar</u></a>&nbsp;as a result of the new regulations 💥</p>\n\n<p>The EU has set up a social fund to ensure that low-income families and individuals aren&rsquo;t put at risk from these changes 🤲 👨&zwj;👧&zwj;👦 Yet, we can&rsquo;t be sure that the fund will be big enough to ensure that furthered inequality, or worse,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/14/eus-green-deal-plans-launched-with-make-or-break-decade-warning\" target=\"_blank\"><u>&lsquo;energy poverty&rsquo;</u></a>, doesn&rsquo;t arise as a result of the transition towards a greener EU.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>3) Aviation and shipping 🛩</h2>\n\n<p>This time around with the Green Deal, there are no excuses nor exceptions 🙅&zwj;♀️ That&rsquo;s why both&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/delivering-european-green-deal_en\" target=\"_blank\">the aviation and shipping industries are expected to be hit hard by the new regulations</a>. For the first time, the shipping industry is being included in the Emissions Trading System, which with its significantly higher carbon prices will force the industry to think of greener supply chains 🚢 ☘️ The airline industry will also have to commit to a greener future, since no plane will be allowed to depart from an EU airport without blended, more sustainable fuel in its tank ⛽</p>\n\n<h2>4) Reforestation 🌳</h2>\n\n<p>Finally, the EU is well-aware that going green isn&rsquo;t just about reducing emissions, but also about managing the carbon that&rsquo;s already there 🤞 The solution? Guarding forests and planting many more trees!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27439165/giphy__32_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27439165/giphy__32_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s basically creating natural carbon &lsquo;sinks&rsquo;, which are now targeted to absorb&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/delivering-european-green-deal_en\" target=\"_blank\"><u>310 megatons of carbon every year</u></a>&nbsp;instead of the 230 that was previously the goal 🐒</p>\n\n<h2>But will these changes actually be felt? 🤨</h2>\n\n<p>Most likely, if you&rsquo;re an EU citizen 🇪🇺 you&rsquo;ll be able to feel small changes in your everyday life: your airplane tickets might become more expensive, and so may your energy bills. Within a few years, you&rsquo;ll probably also feel a change in infrastructure that supports more electric cars around the European highways and makes travelling by rail faster 🛣 🚞</p>\n\n<p>Even if you&rsquo;re not an EU citizen, the new EU Green Deal might affect your local trade patterns or policies ❗️ For example, the EU Emissions Trading System ensures that the EU market isn&rsquo;t undercut by foreign import of materials such as aluminium, steel, cement, and fertilizer coming in from countries such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/the-seven-elements-of-the-eu-green-deal-you-should-care-about\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Norway, China, and Russia</u></a>. It&rsquo;s also a well-known fact that the EU is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to regulations and international law 👩&zwj;⚖️✨ So: even if the Green Deal only concerns the EU, it might also push some agendas abroad.</p>\n\n<h2>So, what does the Green Deal mean in the here and now? 👀</h2>\n\n<p>Transforming the EU to a green EU will be costly 😒 But, with research and consideration for the above goals and its effects on the companies within the most affected industries, you might be able to target not just where you can make an impact, but also where you can make a profit! 💞💰&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Remember that we&rsquo;re lucky to know the EU&rsquo;s targets years ahead of when they&rsquo;re supposed to be lived up to by the sectors they affect! 🏗 If you invest smart, early and for the long-term, you might then see good returns within the coming years.</p>\n\n<p>From here, the rest is up to you!

In reality, there&rsquo;s a lot more to the concept, but the principle stays the same 👯&zwj;♂️ So we can consider it as the income that remunerates the investment you make in a company 🤠 Basically, this income can be defined as:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>1️⃣&nbsp;<strong>A&nbsp;</strong><strong>residual income</strong>, because it is only distributed to shareholders once all other partners in the company have been paid 🤝💼</p>\n\n<p>2️⃣<strong>&nbsp;A&nbsp;</strong><strong>random income</strong>, because it cannot be predicted with precision, as it depends on the current economic and social circumstances and the company&#39;s performance 🤷</p>\n\n<h4>So, how does it work?</h4>\n\n<p>In all cases, the amount of the dividend is proposed by the board of directors 👩&zwj;⚖️ and voted through at the general meeting of shareholders.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476191/giphy__34_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476191/giphy__34_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The resulting amount is generally based on three parameters:</p>\n\n<p>1️⃣&nbsp;<strong>The level of profits made by the company:</strong>&nbsp;Indeed, the dividend is most often taken from the company&rsquo;s profits 💸 And, of course, the greater the profits, the more generous the company can be with their dividends (all other things being equal).</p>\n\n<p>2️⃣&nbsp;<strong>The future investments to be undertaken:&nbsp;</strong>As we&rsquo;ve just seen, the cash flow available for dividends is supposed to have already covered the company&#39;s investments. However, in the case of major projects, shareholders may decide during the general meeting of shareholders to temporarily defer the distribution of dividends 🙅</p>\n\n<p>3️⃣&nbsp;<strong>Shareholders&rsquo; expectations:&nbsp;</strong>Shareholders may voluntarily forgo their expected immediate dividend&rsquo;s income in hopes of higher future income 🤞 Similarly, in the absence of interesting projects, they may decide to distribute the entire year&#39;s profit and even, as a special dividend, draw on the spare reserves already built up.</p>\n\n<h4>For example &hellip;.</h4>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s suppose that you invest in a company that makes the most incredible, magnificent, delicious, and sustainable cakes:&nbsp;<strong>Cake!mpact</strong>&nbsp;🎂</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476194/giphy__35_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476194/giphy__35_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Well, now you buy 100 shares of your favorite cake company for $10 each 🍰 So you&rsquo;ve invested $1,000. And, each share pays a $1 annual dividend (which is a really nice dividend). So, after the course of a year, you would receive $100 in dividend payments. That works out to a 10% dividend yield &ndash; giving you an extra slice of that lovely cake that you bought in for 🎂🍰 Nice! 😋</p>\n\n<p>Now, what can you do with this newly earned money? 🚀 Here&rsquo;s a few common options:</p>\n\n<p>👉 Reinvest them to buy more shares of the company.</p>\n\n<p>👉 Buy stock in a different company.</p>\n\n<p>👉 Save the money.</p>\n\n<p>👉 Spend the money (for example use it to buy a takeaway coffee to have alongside your favorite cake ☕️)</p>\n\n<h4>Btw &ndash; here&#39;s some tools to analyse a company&rsquo;s dividend policy!</h4>\n\n<p>Finally, there are three main indicators that will allow you to analyse the dividend policy of a company:</p>\n\n<p><strong>The payout ratio:&nbsp;</strong>This refers to the portion of net income distributed as a dividend. So, if a company pays $0.25 per share dividend and earns $1 per share in net income, the payout ratio is 25%. Generally, the lower the payout ratio, the more durable a dividend should be 🤘</p>\n\n<p><strong>The DPS (Dividend Per Share):</strong>&nbsp;As the name suggests, the DPS indicates the dividends issued by the company for every outstanding share 😇&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The dividend yield:</strong>&nbsp;This is measured by dividing the dividend per share by the price per share. Expressed in percentages to simplify the comparison over time and performance in relation to other shares 📈⏳, it&#39;s a good tool to manage your share portfolio.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve learned more about a concept as positive as dividends, there&rsquo;s no reason for you to not get started investing. There&rsquo;s money to get in return and an impact to leave behind. So be the movement &ndash; make!mpact 🤗🌍</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476201/giphy__36_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476201/giphy__36_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n","a_creation":"17/08/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

Furthermore,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ban.org/news/2018/8/9/when-green-is-not-bikeshare-companies-called-out-for-dumping-e-waste-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">the&nbsp;<u>bikes become electronic waste</u></a>&nbsp;📱🗑 Even normal, non-motorized bikeshare bikes contain hazardous lithium-ion batteries and toxic circuit boards which need a different form of recycling than normal metal 🔋 So, as green and sustainable as the business model seems, companies like Donkey Republic produce large amounts of garbage and need to &lsquo;establish responsible end-of-life policies&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Social factors</h4>\n\n<p>There are no major red flags in terms of social risks for Donkey Republic, but there are some considerations that could be addressed by bike-sharing companies in general: one example being transport affordability 🚨 Bike sharing is cheaper than owning a car, but there are still many citizens who are unbanked or cannot afford to pay $1 per ride 😕 Special city programmes (such as $5 annual passes for low-income households) allow everyone to benefit from the network, minimising discrepancies in wealth and ownership of bicycles. Another solution could be to integrate the bikes into public transport! 🌐</p>\n\n<p>In terms of service area, it&#39;s up to the bicycle companies where to place docking stations or where to expand their service area. Some low-income areas could simply be excluded. In San Francisco, for example, at least 20% of docking stations must be in these low-income communities 👌 Donkey Republic also plans to expand into cities of different tier-level cities and not just focus on the main cities.</p>\n\n<h4>Governance factors</h4>\n\n<p>Donkey Republic allows individual entrepreneurs and companies to make use of its brand and establish their own bike-sharing hubs in their preferred locations. Depending on the individual contracts, Donkey Republic often supports investments and takes over the marketing in order to keep a unified brand 👨&zwj;💻💸 These costs are also split. Nonetheless, the contracts allow for flexibility and opportunities for co-branding in specific cases.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the board consists of 6 members, out of which only two are independent 😳 The other four members are shareholders of the firm. One can say that this is not an independent board and could potentially lead to biased controlling in favor of their investments 🤔</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476399/giphy__39_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476399/giphy__39_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>In terms of transparency, the company, in addition to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://invest.donkey.bike/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/28042021_Donkey_Republic_brochure_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Investors Memo</u></a>, provides a spreadsheet with more detailed calculations and sources to provide greater transparency on how impact and savings are calculated 🔍</p>\n\n<h2>Financials</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476294/1628847647780.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476294/1628847647780.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" style=\"width:602px\" title=\"Diagramm\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476295/1628847647649.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476295/1628847647649.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" style=\"width:602px\" title=\"Diagramm\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>As Donkey Republic is still a young company 👶 there is no extensive financial information available about the enterprise yet. Clearly, the firm is building and expanding its operations and is not making a profit yet 🗃 The EBIT amounted to DKK&nbsp;<a href=\"https://invest.donkey.bike/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/FINAL-Annual-report-2020-Donkeyrepublic-Holding-ApS.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>-23,740 in 2020</u></a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, the company forecasts to be profitable by 2024, with a turnover between DKK 185-225 million and a profit margin between 5-10% 📈✨ To achieve this target, Donkey Republic plans to expand into what they label Tier 2 (200 thousand to 1 million inhabitants) and Tier 3 (30 thousand to 200 thousand inhabitants) cities 🗺 This expansion is supported by a high share of public funding.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the lifting of restrictions in the wake of COVID-19 and the increasingly vaccinated population will allow more tourists to visit the cities in which Donkey Republic operates, driving up revenues 🤑 While revenues in 2020 decreased to DKK 21.6 million from DKK 33.4 million in 2019, the figures still indicate a healthy, loyal and primarily local customer base. Pre-pandemic, Donkey Republic already managed to run its MaaS operations in its established cities profitably 💪</p>\n\n<p>In 2024, Donkey Republic expects to expand its bike fleet to more than 53,000 bikes and e-bikes. As mentioned, this will represent a growth rate of 15-20%, which is higher than the average market growth of 14%, according to statistics 📊 Public funding paid by municipalities to set-up a bike-sharing solution accounts for 55% of sales, which is quite significant!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>With a deal win-rate of 59% from 2018 to 2020, the company has a solid value proposition for cities 👐🏙 Its close cooperation with cities and significant market experience puts it ahead of some competitors, including e-scooter providers that are also entering the bike-sharing market 😏</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476411/giphy__40_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476411/giphy__40_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The company plans to use the DKK 110 million in capital raised from its IPO for business development (15%), software development (25%), hardware development (10%) and fleet expansion (30%), and will keep what they call a &quot;war chest for blockbuster deals&quot; of about 20% 👛💰</p>\n\n<p>In terms of valuation, green and sustainable companies often benefit from a premium (higher stock price than intrinsic value), just like Donkey Republic. There are not many listed bike-sharing companies, which makes an industry comparison considerably difficult 😬 The Price-to-Sales multiple is 8.2 and the Enterprise Value-to-Sales multiple is 4.6. The management estimated 2024 EV-to-Sales multiple to be 0.8, which is slightly lower than its United States-based competitor Helbiz&#39; multiple of 0.9 ⚖️ With a current market cap of &euro;25 million, the company trades higher than its pre-money valuation of &euro;17.3 million.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>All right, to sum up all of this information: Donkey Republic definitely serves current demands and trends with its sustainable solution to affordable transport ✅ The business model with a focus on profitable growth instead of fast growth and public financing is a more defensive approach than many of Donkey Republic&rsquo;s competitors pursue, but could turn out to be a major success driver 😎</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476419/giphy__41_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476419/giphy__41_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n","a_creation":"19/08/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

This number increased by up to 161 million people from 2019 as a result of the pandemic 😷</p>\n\n<p>Global hunger has been particularly on the rise since 2014, with currently 25.9% of the world&rsquo;s population affected by moderate or severe food insecurity.

So, why is it that so many people suffer from hunger when we are able to provide food for everybody? 😒</p>\n\n<p>There are many reasons for the persisting hunger in the world. For one thing, there is a strong correlation with poverty, which stems from social, political and economic factors. Other factors include wars and conflicts that lead to instability and cause famines ⚔️ Another major impactor is weather. It sounds simple: If there is no rain, there will be no grain &hellip; 🌧🚫</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, many organizations are fighting world hunger, sparking hopes that the 2030 target can still be met. Furthermore, sustainable consumption trends, such as becoming vegetarian or even vegan 🥬 may also present a solution for the future.

One thing that has become clear after the pandemic is that food chain safety needs improvement &ndash; and vertical farming could be one solution. Not only can land be used more efficiently, it also allows individuals to select and freshly pick fruits and vegetables on-site when they are needed 🤞&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For example, salads, basil or mint could be grown locally on-site in supermarkets, schools, restaurants, or basically wherever and whenever consumers want fresh products 🥗💆 Fresh produce can then end up on our plates minutes later!</p>\n\n<p>But who comes up with all these ideas &hellip; and who funds them? 🤔 Oftentimes, it is the startup sector, composed of the most innovative and brilliant entrepreneurial minds 🧠 that brings these inventions to light.

Let&rsquo;s get to it! 😎</p>\n\n<h2>Company introduction</h2>\n\n<p>GreenMobility was established in 2016 and went public in 2017. According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greenmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GreenMobility-Annual-Report-2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>their annual report</u></a>, the Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) business went from having only 40 cars operating in Copenhagen at launch to 950 cars in 2020, spread across four European countries: Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Belgium 🔥&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Their growth and success is largely driven by the increasing trends in urbanization and care for the environment 🌆🌳 Cities continue to grow larger, and, instead of having to pay hefty prices for car maintenance and parking spots, it&rsquo;s becoming easier to simply rent a vehicle on-demand. These rising on-demand services are greatly complemented by the fact that when urban dwellers need a fast transportation option, GreenMobility offers a green and sustainable one 🥳</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476936/giphy__46_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476936/giphy__46_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s also notable that whilst the company is best known for their Business-to-Consumer (B2C) services, they operate Business-to-Business (B2B) too, with offerings available to companies who wish to ensure green mobilization for their employees 👨&zwj;💼🤝 Finally, it should be noted that the cars GreenMobility operate in their fleet are Renault&rsquo;s Zoe and Kangoo models.</p>\n\n<h2>Sustainable Development Goals</h2>\n\n<p>GreenMobility themselves state in their annual report that they strive to directly impact three SDGs:&nbsp;<em>Sustainable Cities and Communities</em>,&nbsp;<em>Responsible Consumption and Production</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Climate Action</em>. With the effect of electric cars and carsharing in mind, these goals indeed seem plausibly impacted by the business 🏆 Let&rsquo;s delve into them individually:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476909/1628849625009.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476909/1628849625009.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" style=\"width:624px\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities</h4>\n\n<p>Decreasing carbon emissions in metropolitan areas 🙅&zwj;♂️💨 &nbsp;is essential to sustainable cities. GreenMobility&rsquo;s vehicles being electric, the company contributes to reducing carbon emissions. Furthermore, there is a great green aspect in GreenMobility&rsquo;s electric cars: it increases the demand for electric charging stations in cities. With increasing accessibility and numbers of chargers, the general consumer may also become more inclined to swap their fossil fuel-driven vehicle for an electric one 🔋 This would increase the demand for electric cars, leading to more sustainable cities! 🙌&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, GreenMobility stands out as particularly interesting in their participation in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lira-project.dk/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the LiRA project</u></a>. It&rsquo;s a collaboration between the Danish Road Directorate, the Technical University of Denmark, consulting firm SWECO, and GreenMobility 🛣🤝📱 It seeks to, through sensors in GreenMobility&rsquo;s cars, collect data from Danish roads to assess their physical condition and &ldquo;revolutionize the way road infrastructure is maintained&rdquo; to save money on road maintenance 🤩&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production</h4>\n\n<p>The sharing economy revolves around responsible consumption &ndash; and, when we talk cars, carsharing reduces the amount of cars in circulation 😇 While results of research are broad, it&rsquo;s estimated that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/how-green-is-the-sharing-economy/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>one carsharing vehicle is capable of taking between 5-20 cars off the road</u></a>! 🎉 This is especially significant considering reports that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.racfoundation.org/research/mobility/spaced-out-perspectives-on-parking\" target=\"_blank\"><u>cars are, on average, parked 96% of the time</u></a>. With the average car only being used in 4% of its lifespan, the movement towards increased carsharing seems an important one to limit superfluous consumption and production 👌</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476971/giphy__47_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476971/giphy__47_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>SDG 13: Climate Action</h4>\n\n<p>As already made clear from the discussion of GreenMobility&rsquo;s electric cars reducing urban carbon emissions, it is evident that GreenMobility has a positive effect in combating climate change ✊ In 2019, the Karlsruhe Institute for Technology conducted&nbsp;<a href=\"https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000104216\" target=\"_blank\"><u>a study on carsharing across eleven European cities</u></a>&nbsp;and found that carsharing had the potential to decrease their GHG emissions by, on average, 29% per driver ↘️&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the studied fleets of various carsharing companies comprised mainly combustion-engines &ndash; but imagine the environmental impact if purely electrical fleets like those of GreenMobility were considered in that study! 🌱 In GreenMobility&rsquo;s own&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greenmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GreenMobility-ESG-Sustainability-Report-2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>sustainability report</u></a>, they note that whilst their fleet emitted 95.2 tonnes of CO2 in 2020, it saved 774.7 tonnes from being emitted by fossil-fueled cars 🥳 Finally, as more cars are taken out of circulation due to companies such as GreenMobility, less greenhouse gases are also emitted as less cars are produced!</p>\n\n<h2>ESG risks&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h4>Environmental</h4>\n\n<p>If you hadn&rsquo;t noticed by the exaggerated mention of it in this article so far, carsharing appears to be a great action for our climate. However, though GreenMobility&rsquo;s carsharing service is good for carbon savings through promoting the use of electrical cars, there may be a cause for concern to be found in the production of these cars 😒&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For one, GreenMobility&rsquo;s fleet vehicles, Renault&rsquo;s Zoe and Kangoo models, generate carbon emissions when they are produced, contributing to atmospheric pollution 🛰💨 Renault is working towards becoming a greener corporation, already operating&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.renaultgroup.com/en/news-on-air/news/the-tangier-plant-zero-emissions-and-zero-industrial-effluent-discharges/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>a zero-emission production plant</u></a>&nbsp;for cars in their Darcia brand, but for the models that GreenMobility operate with, GHG emissions are still an issue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the EV batteries installed in Renault&rsquo;s cars are lithium-ion batteries&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greenmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GreenMobility-ESG-Sustainability-Report-2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>that require lithium- and cobalt extraction</u></a>&nbsp;🔋 The mining processes of both of these chemical elements&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/lithium-batteries-environment-impact\" target=\"_blank\">put surrounding environments at&nbsp;<u>risk of toxic pollution</u></a>, and, for lithium in particular,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/lithium-batteries-environment-impact\" target=\"_blank\">the extraction of one tonne of the element is estimated to consume, on average,&nbsp;<u>1.89 million litres of water</u></a>&nbsp;🤯🚰</p>\n\n<h4>Social</h4>\n\n<p>Firstly, GreenMobility&rsquo;s services may appear pricy to many 💰 At DKK 4 per minute at the standard fare, a trip does not seem immediately accessible to low-income drivers, especially considering the risk for inner city congestion that could prolong otherwise short trips and, hence, drain wallets 😣 GreenMobility offers packages, prepaid minutes, and subscriptions to lower the per-minute fare price, but they require larger initial payments to be utilized. For the lower-income person with less money to spare, the opportunities to sustainably use the company&rsquo;s green transport methods are therefore arguably sparse 🧐</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27477006/giphy__48_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27477006/giphy__48_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Secondly, as a company whose services rely on consumers using an app to rent their vehicles, GreenMobility has risks in terms of data security 📳 According to their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greenmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GreenMobility-ESG-Sustainability-Report-2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>sustainability report</u></a>, the company stores data on Google servers via Google Cloud. Whilst the data security of a conglomerate like Google is imaginably much better than what GreenMobility could ensure themselves, Google is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greenmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GreenMobility-ESG-Sustainability-Report-2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>not immune to security holes and data breaches</u></a>&nbsp;👾</p>\n\n<h4>Governance</h4>\n\n<p>Corporate governance-wise, one may first note that GreenMobility&rsquo;s board appears well-balanced in terms of gender: males and females comprise a ratio of 40/60 according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greenmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GreenMobility-Annual-Report-2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>GreenMobility&rsquo;s 2020 annual report</u></a>&nbsp;👫 Moreover, following&nbsp;<a href=\"https://corporategovernance.dk/recommendations-corporate-governance\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the recommendations of the Danish Committee on Corporate Governance</u></a>&nbsp;that at least half of a company&rsquo;s board should be independent, GreenMobility reports that four out of five of the company&rsquo;s board members are independent 💅 This is a positive trait, as it means the Board of Directors is better enabled to engage in decision-making without being biased by conflicts of interest.</p>\n\n<h2>Financials</h2>\n\n<p>To address the elephant in the room: GreenMobility&rsquo;s numbers are not green 😧🚫 Yet, at least! GreenMobility has been facing losses since its inception in 2016, with a recent EBIT (Earnings Before Income Taxes) of DKK -59 million from their 2020 operations. This is down from DKK -29 million in 2019 📉 However, the global COVID-19 pandemic is evidently much culpable for the losses, having caused less people to travel outside of their homes and, for those that have, a hesitance to share cars and devices that have been used by others before them 🤷&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476908/1628849624709.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476908/1628849624709.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" style=\"width:588px\" title=\"Diagramm\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Similar trends to that of the company&rsquo;s EBIT is seen in GreenMobility&rsquo;s negative Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE) figures. Essentially, the company is not yet generating enough profits to compensate for the money invested into its success 👀&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Being a business that is in its growth phase, however, it is not unsensible that GreenMobility isn&#39;t yet making profits &ndash; instead of seeking to increase margins, resources are being invested into expanding their market 📈 Ample hope in the company can perhaps be gathered from knowing that the business division in Copenhagen is already running profitably ✅ &nbsp;&ndash; for other locations, like Antwerp in Belgium where GreenMobility launched in 2020, the company expects operational profitability within three to four years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476907/1628849624942.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27476907/1628849624942.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" style=\"width:523px\" title=\"Diagramm\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>By 2025, GreenMobility aims to be &quot;the leading mobility provider in Europe&quot; 💪 powered by an expansion from the current 7 cities to a total of 35 and an increase from 950 electrical vehicles to more than 10,000 ❗️ With this growth, GreenMobility expects to reach an EBIT margin of 20%. In other words, the company expects their earnings before interests and taxes to exceed their business costs by a profitable margin 😎</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27477048/giphy__49_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27477048/giphy__49_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>GreenMobility are roaming the streets of major European cities &ndash; maybe you&rsquo;ll want them to roam in your portfolio too? In the short-run, their financials appear in shades of red, but, in the long run, there&rsquo;s a lot of potential for growth and green figures 🤗 However, even though profits are prospected, the underlying financials are only part of the game &ndash; from a sustainable investing point of view, the impact of carsharing companies like GreenMobility are, as seen, powerful and interesting 🧠⚡️ With the potential to reduce the amount of cars and their emissions in urban areas, their contributions may play a key role in the quest for a sustainable future! ♻️💸</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","a_creation":"24/08/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

Let&#39;s break it down!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A&nbsp;<em>token</em>, like any cryptocurrency, is a digitised asset. 💻 A certain value is assigned to this token. Since the token is digital, it becomes tradable and therefore it&rsquo;s able to fluctuate in value. 💹</p>\n\n<p>This is where the&nbsp;<strong><em>non-fungible</em></strong>&nbsp;part comes in. In economics,&nbsp;<em>fungible</em>&nbsp;basically means that the individual unit (here, the token) is exchangeable and indistinguishable. When I exchange one Bitcoin for another Bitcoin, I therefore still have the same value in my wallet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Non-fungible</strong></em>, however, means unique and recognisable. Since non-fungible tokens are tied to individual assets, they also have a unique value. 😇💵 When I exchange them for each other, I receive a different value.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>A brief backstory</strong></p>\n\n<p>The first appearance of NFTs was back in 2012 when it was called&nbsp;<em>Colored Coins.</em>&nbsp;🎨 One drawback of these coins was that they only represented value if everyone agreed on it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>At that time, they were still based on the&nbsp;<em>Bitcoin</em>&nbsp;blockchain. A few years later, it shifted more towards the&nbsp;<em>Ethereum</em>&nbsp;blockchain, allowing for unique tokens to be created and were named NFTs. 💁&zwj;♀️ In 2017, NFTs started entering the mainstream, partly due to CryptoKitties, a virtual blockchain game where virtual kittens could be raised, adopted and traded. 🐈</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27831345/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27831345/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>NFTs originally aimed to give artists more power and control over their artwork. 🖼✊ Artists could sell their artwork very easily and even profit from each transaction and price increase. For buyers, it was a great way to support their favourite artist and acquire the rights to use and brag about owning the original. 🗣</p>\n\n<p>The market got bigger and bigger and experienced genuine hype. 🔥 In March 2021, the high-end auction house&nbsp;<em>Christie&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;put a collage by the artist Beeple up for sale. The work, containing 5,000 individual artworks, sold at the auction for $69.3 million! 😲</p>\n\n<p>Today many people hold NFTs to escape inflation and others buy and hold different NFT artworks and wait for a skyrocketing value to sell again. 🤑</p>\n\n<p><strong>But tell me again &ndash; what exactly does an NFT mean in the world of cryptocurrency?</strong></p>\n\n<p>NFTs are based on a blockchain, a decentralised database 👩&zwj;💻 All previous transaction details are stored in individual blocks which ultimately form a chain of blocks. ⛓ For this reason, the ownership of a coin can easily be determined by reading the last block in its chain. Due to this identifiability, blockchain technology is very secure against fraud. 🔒</p>\n\n<p>In addition to a cryptocurrency, NFTs contain additional information that links them to a specific item. This digital token now has the value and ownership of that specific item. Because these tokens are unique, each token has its own specific asset value. 🧮</p>\n\n<p>Digital content is easy to send or trade on the internet, 🌐 but there are many tangible assets in the world that cannot be digitised, such as physical paintings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27831380/giphy__1_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27831380/giphy__1_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>NFTs are used to convert these real assets into digital assets by assigning its value to a token. Both digital content and digitised content then can be sold and traded on platforms. 👾🖼 As with any asset, the price is determined by the market.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Understood &ndash; but if I buy a digital file such as a JPEG image, can I just download it?!&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes, you can do that! 😎 However, the downloaded version is no longer part of the blockchain system and, therefore, does not have the same value as the original. ❗️ It is similar to the concept that there is only&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;original Mona Lisa, but many different copies. The one original NFT is the one that is ingrained in the blockchain and every download creates a new copy. 🖨</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can anyone just create and sell NFTs?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Of course, you can also create your own content and sell it on a platform 🎉 The most well-known exchanges where you can buy NFTs are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://opensea.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>OpenSea</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rarible.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Rarible</u></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mintable.app/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Mintable</u></a>. NFTs are bought with cryptocurrencies, which is why buyers and sellers need a cryptocurrency wallet. 👛</p>\n\n<p><strong>So, why are they so popular?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s impossible to say for sure why the popularity of NFTs have soared in recent months. 🤷 The popularity and price is of course influenced by different artists, but the general hype around blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies has also driven up the prices of NFTs. 📈 Another reason might be the COVID-19 pandemic that&rsquo;s forced us to live a more or less digital life. 📱 Owning digital assets has become much more common and easier to get by!</p>\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t jump into NFTs without a second thought, though! They comprise some important&nbsp;<a href=\"https://de.statista.com/infografik/18608/stromverbrauch-ausgewaehlter-laender-im-vergleich-mit-dem-des-bitcoins/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>environmental problems</u></a>. 🧐🌱 For example, today, most NFTs are based on Ethereum blockchain technology, which &ndash; true &ndash; has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://memoakten.medium.com/the-unreasonable-ecological-cost-of-cryptoart-2221d3eb2053\" target=\"_blank\"><u>s</u><u>lightly better energy efficiency than Bitcoin</u></a>. But still, on average, a NFT artwork requires 340 kWh of electricity, which is 10% of the total annual electricity demand of the average household in Germany! 👨&zwj;👩&zwj;👧&zwj;👧🏠🔌 This is the equivalent of 211 kg of carbon emissions &ndash; similar to those of a two-hour flight.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27831408/giphy__2_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27831408/giphy__2_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Aaaand to sum it all up &hellip;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Living in a digital age, you may want to know about cryptocurrencies such as NFTs as an investor. 🧠⚡️ They have benefits in its good resistance to inflation and in their ability to trade assets such as art. However, you should also be aware of their environmental footprint &ndash; which can actually be quite big.

We picked this company because we believe that it is a great example of creating real impact through technology. 💾 So let&rsquo;s dive into the specifics on how they make an impact! 🏊🏻</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27835545/giphy__3_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Company introduction</strong></p>\n\n<p>The California-based company NVIDIA was founded in 1993 by Jen-Hsu Huang. The visual computing company and high-end chipmaker specializes in producing semiconductors that power AI-technologies ranging from high-performance gaming to autonomous vehicles. 🚙 They are mostly known for their brand GeForce, under which the company sells GPUs which may likely be built into your very own device. 💻📱</p>\n\n<p>Other than manufacturing GPUs, NVIDIA develops data center platforms and systems for AI and high-performance computing. Their products are applied in various industries from energy and healthcare to Gaming, Robotics to even Smart Cities and Transportation. Because of this,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA?p=NVDA&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\" target=\"_blank\"><u>four large markets depend critically on NVIDIA expertise</u></a>: gaming, professional visualisation, datacenter and automotive markets - crazy right?! 🤯</p>\n\n<h4><strong>Sustainable Development Goals</strong></h4>\n\n<p>We now know who they are and what they do, so now let&rsquo;s find out which SDGs they address! &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27835265/1629728769825.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" style=\"height:347px; width:602px\" /></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>Starting with one of their most impactful areas: &lsquo;Clara&rsquo;, their healthcare application framework, is key in helping scientists and clinicians use AI in order to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/clara\" target=\"_blank\"><u>innovate areas such as drug discovery and disease detection</u>&nbsp;</a>and contributed to the development of Covid-19 vaccines. 🧬🧪 Its increased diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging can drastically improve patient outcomes. 🩺&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27835628/giphy__4_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>\n\n<p>NVIDIA also built the UK&#39;s<a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-building-uks-most-powerful-supercomputer-dedicated-to-ai-research-in-healthcare\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;<u>most powerful supercomputer, &lsquo;Cambridge-1&rsquo;</u></a>. It has been made available to science, empowering researchers to collaborate and share knowledge in different fields. 🦠🤖</p>\n\n<p>Another milestone towards SDG 3 is NVIDIA&rsquo;s advancement in the field of autonomous driving (AD). Despite being one of the leaders in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/innovation/best-autonomous-driving-companies\" target=\"_blank\"><u>autonomous software and hardware</u></a>, there is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-self-driving-idUSKBN23B294\" target=\"_blank\"><u>controversy about how many human driving errors and, in turn, deaths can be avoided</u></a>&nbsp;by safely functioning autonomous vehicles (AVs).

While its financial performance was indeed affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with lower revenues, EBIT and profit margin, the stock price development of NVIDIA has not suffered nearly as much as that of other industries, such as aviation or tourism. 🔝 The same stock price persistence generally applied to the entire technology industry, including some of NVIDIA&rsquo;s key competitors like Intel, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) or Hewlett Packard (HP). &nbsp;🆗</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/36994586/1648033997688.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/36994620/1648034062544.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, NVIDIA&rsquo;s shares significantly outperformed their competitors, having increased by over 600% since 2017! 🙆&zwj;♀️😱 This might be particularly attributed to NVIDIA&rsquo;s industry- and technology leadership, driven by investor confidence in the groundbreaking AI technology in areas including health care and AD. ⚕️🤖🦾 These high expectations are also incorporated into the company&rsquo;s valuation, with the Price/Sales and EV/Revenue multiples both yielding values well above 20!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27836245/giphy__8_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>\n\n<p>NVIDIA has transitioned from serving the gaming market only, to applying its technology to advancing challenges and opportunities of global scale and importance. 🌎 With its market-leading role in AI, NVIDIA is likely to have a big impact on industries such as health care and transportation. 🏥🚗🚕 Investors celebrate this exciting outlook with a remarkably high share price and valuation.🤩 One should however not forget the fundamental ESG risks to NVIDIA&rsquo;s business, which circle around humongous energy demands and the high dependency on external suppliers, as well as around the trustworthiness and security vulnerability of its products.☝️</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27835484/photo-1485827404703-89b55fcc595e.jpeg?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","a_creation":"29/08/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

Likewise, when you deposit money in a savings account, the interest is the return which your bank pays you on that deposit. 🏦💵</p>\n\n<p>Any interest is based on an&nbsp;<em>interest rate</em>&nbsp;&ndash; and there are actually different kinds of interest rates. 🔢 So, let&rsquo;s first explain what they are and how they work!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27866473/giphy__13_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27866473/giphy__13_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h1>So, what&rsquo;s an interest rate? 🤔&nbsp;</h1>\n\n<p>An interest rate expresses the aforementioned cost or return as a percentage of the amount you borrow or lend. That&rsquo;s why, when you want to take out a loan, you&rsquo;re looking for the lowest interest rate and, when you want to deposit money, you&rsquo;re looking for the highest interest rate. That makes sense! 😎</p>\n\n<p>Slight subtlety: interest rates are set by commercial banks to match the day-to-day policy rate given by the central banks, due to the fact that commercial banks also take loans from central banks. 📆 This means, that when a central bank increases its policy rates in order to control the money supply and regulate economic activity, the commercial banks of its jurisdiction&ndash;&nbsp;a country, or economic region like the EU&ndash; must also raise theirs. ↗️</p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re particularly observant, you may have noticed that if the interest rate changes from day to day, it would be almost impossible to determine the final cost or return you would get on a loan or deposit. 😣&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27866502/giphy__14_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27866502/giphy__14_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>For that reason, interest payments are based on, primarily, these three principles:</p>\n\n<ul>\n        <li>\n        <p><strong>1️⃣ Fixed interest rates:</strong>&nbsp;This means that, from the beginning to the end, you will always have the same rate as when you sign the initial contract. This is safer, but can also be less profitable because banks deliberately set this rate high (on loans) to cover the risks of variating policy rates. 🥲</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n        <p><strong>2️⃣ Variable interest rates:&nbsp;</strong>As the name suggests, your loan or deposit rate will be subject to change and is derived from above mentioned policy rates. This type of interest also has safety features that allow you to set a minimum or maximum limit of variation. These are what we call the&nbsp;floor&nbsp;and&nbsp;cap&nbsp;interest rates.</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n        <p><strong>3️⃣ Mixed interest rates:&nbsp;</strong>This is a combination of the fixed and variable interest rates. For example, a mixed rate could comprise a fixed rate for the first five years and then a variable one until the end. 🔀</p>\n        </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27866583/giphy__15_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27866583/giphy__15_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>So, now after having glimpsed at the basics of the functioning of interest rates, let&rsquo;s take a look at the main types of interest rates.🤪</p>\n\n<p><strong>The nominal interest rate</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is the most basic type of interest rate. It&rsquo;s the rate actually agreed upon and paid or earned. 🤝 For example, consider the case where you deposit $100 into an account with a 10% annual interest rate (which isn&rsquo;t representative of the current interest rates and only serves as an explanation). If you leave the money in your account for one year, by the end of that year you will have $110 &ndash; you have earned $10 in interest. For sitting back and doing nothing, that&#39;s pretty nice, right?! 😎</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27866613/giphy__16_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27866613/giphy__16_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>The real interest rate</strong></p>\n\n<p>Bad news: life is not so simple&hellip; 😳 There is a factor that changes our initial predictions:&nbsp;<em>inflation</em>. 😲 That&rsquo;s why the real interest rate has been invented: it takes inflation into account and will help you refine your predictions for the short, medium and long term.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s illustrate the concept with our previous example. With a deposit of $100 and an interest profit of $10, now consider an inflation rate of 5%. As a consequence, &nbsp;the real interest rate is actually only 5%, which means your real interest income isn&#39;t $10 but rather $5. 😬</p>\n\n<p><strong>The annual percentage rate (APR)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Bad news again: life is complicated! 😱 Now that we know our nominal interest rate and how to interpret it in relation to future inflation, we might be tempted to think that our estimate cannot get more accurate. 😮&zwj;💨 However, there is more: we haven&rsquo;t yet considered the other fees generated by our loan or deposit: &nbsp;application fees, insurance, additional banking services, you name it&hellip; 🙄</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s why we consider APR: it helps us to choose the most suitable and cheap bank offering for our needs. 😢😡</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27866693/giphy__17_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27866693/giphy__17_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>With these three interest rates in your pocket, you&rsquo;ve now acquired a good foundation. 🤩 But as always, there is more to learn about this topic and we encourage you to explore various other interest rates and read more into how the real interest and annual percentage rate are calculated. 👊&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27866428/photo-1556155092-490a1ba16284.jpeg?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27866428/photo-1556155092-490a1ba16284.jpeg?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n","a_creation":"02/09/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

This model is famously criticized due to its immense pollution and frequent poor labor conditions.💨😤</p>\n\n<p>But, as always, the industry is evolving, and a future of sustainable fashion seems to be taking shape. 😍</p>\n\n<h2>What are the future perspectives of the industry? 🤔</h2>\n\n<p>For the fashion industry, the COVID-19 pandemic changed a lot. Indeed,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/retail/our%20insights/state%20of%20fashion/2021/the-state-of-fashion-2021-vf.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><em>a report by McKinsey &amp; Company</em></a>&nbsp;found that &ldquo;COVID-19 and the economic crisis is the top challenge for 2021 for 45% of fashion executives and stakeholders.&rdquo; 😮&zwj;💨 Moreover, the report found that global fashion sales in 2021 could be below pre-pandemic levels by as much as 15%. 📉 Furthermore, due to the many lockdowns, half of the European consumers have shopped less in physical stores and led to a considerable development in e-commerce. 💻 This means we are at the dawn of a paradigm shift that will force&nbsp;<strong>sustainable fashion</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>circular business models</strong>&nbsp;where clothes are bought, used, and resold for someone else to wear (as especially seen in online marketplaces). ♻️👍 But as Macklemore puts it, one man&rsquo;s trash, that&rsquo;s another man&rsquo;s come-up!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27867302/giphy__20_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27867302/giphy__20_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>These two solutions, the decrease in shopping in stores and the increase in circular business models, are highlighting new ways for people to consume. This also means that more and more people become attentive to end-to-end sustainable products. 👀 As an example, a T-shirt made from organic fibres produced in relocalized production sites is a more sustainable alternative to fast fashion-produced clothing. 👕👚 Thus, with these new movements, people have, through their&nbsp;<em>collective action</em>, succeeded to inspire a new dynamic into one of the world&#39;s largest industries.🏭 What a lesson!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27867329/giphy__21_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27867329/giphy__21_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>However the COVID-19 crisis has not only intensified pre-existing critiques of consumerism and heightened the importance of sustainability in purchasing decisions, but it also contributed to the rise of circular business models. ⭕️ Especially resale. If you are wondering what a circular business model could consist of, have a look at the picture below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://srip-circular-economy.eu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27867055/1629791332872.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" style=\"height:199px; width:256px\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>With this new kind of model&ndash;now not only found in thrift shops but also online&ndash; a garment is no longer dumped but sold on so that another person can wear it. And that&#39;s how you turn a fashion victim into an eco-responsible clothes saviour. 🙌😎</p>\n\n<h2>Beware of greenwashing! 😩</h2>\n\n<p>As you may have gathered, brands are making great efforts to propose more sustainable products. However, there&rsquo;s no doubt that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/amynguyen/2021/07/11/time-to-go-cold-turkey--new-report-explores-fashions-harmful-addiction-to-fossil-fuel-based-fabrics-and-greenwashing/?sh=20e33ef4146e\" target=\"_blank\"><u>some are simply greenwashing</u></a>&nbsp;to sell more clothes (with companies selling e.g. a &ldquo;T-shirt made of organic cotton&rdquo; which are still produced in polluting factories and subcontracted to workshops that do not respect their workers). 😡 We should beware of this kind of practice, as it is, unfortunately, quite common. ☝️</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27867396/giphy__22_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27867396/giphy__22_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Finally, a part of the answer was already given to us more than 40 years ago in 1979 by US President Jimmy Carter when he warned us that &ldquo;human identity is no longer defined by what one&nbsp;<em>does</em>, but by what one&nbsp;<em>owns</em>, [...] and that owning things and consuming things does not satisfy our longing for meaning.&rdquo; 🤵&zwj;♂️ Nowadays, these words resonate with even more force when we know how much our planet has suffered and is suffering from our overconsumption.🤯</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why all of us should try to make a positive impact by buying sustainable clothes, making sustainable investments, recycling more, and, generally, engaging in the activities that make an impact! 🥰</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27867447/giphy__23_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27867447/giphy__23_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><em><u><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27867186/photo-1490481651871-ab68de25d43d.jpeg?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27867186/photo-1490481651871-ab68de25d43d.jpeg?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></u></em></p>\n","a_creation":"05/09/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

And can factor investing be combined with impact investing, and if so, how? 🧐 Hang on here, some juicy stuff is comin&rsquo;!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27867986/giphy__25_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27867986/giphy__25_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Basics</strong></p>\n\n<p>With factor investing, you choose your investment based on specific criteria, called factors, which have historically been linked with higher returns, so you have more for your money! 📜 💸 Overall, there are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/factor-investing.asp\" target=\"_blank\"><u>two key types of factors</u></a>: 1)&nbsp;<em>macroeconomic&nbsp;</em>factors and 2)&nbsp;<em>style</em>&nbsp;factors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If you cannot come up with plausible explanations of what belongs to those categories, let us help you. 😎 Macroeconomic factors capture the&nbsp;<em>broader risks which can be applied to different asset classes</em>. The most common macroeconomic factors are the inflation rate, GDP growth and unemployment rate. ☝️ You might think now: &ldquo;Nice, but what is the underlying idea of this?&rdquo;. 🙃 Well, take GDP growth as an example: if an economy is experiencing a period of higher growth, as an example because everybody is buying a lot of things, it is likely that&nbsp;<em>most</em>&nbsp;kinds of assets in that country will experience growth and have higher returns. 🤑🛍</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27868213/giphy__26_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27868213/giphy__26_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>On the contrary, style factors such as&nbsp;<em>value, size, and quality</em>, try to explain risks and returns&nbsp;<em>within specific asset classes</em>. If this sounded like you need to open google in order to understand this, don&rsquo;t! We are here to help.😉 From now on, we will focus on introducing you to the world of style factors for a very simple reason: they allow you to build a portfolio that has a chance to outperform the market based on&nbsp;<em>your own</em>&nbsp;active choices. 🎯</p>\n\n<p>For example, screening for the style factor&nbsp;<em>Value</em>&nbsp;means identifying companies who have low market values compared to their book values &ndash; such companies are expected to perform better in the future. 🥇 This is because, in contrast to companies that are overhyped on the market (high market value compared to book value), companies with a relatively low market value may be&nbsp;<em>under the radar</em>&nbsp;and still have a huge potential to grow and catch up. 🤪 Gotta catch &lsquo;em all&hellip;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27868261/giphy__27_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27868261/giphy__27_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the factor&nbsp;<em>Size</em>&nbsp;explains that historically, stocks with smaller market capitalization have outperformed stocks with larger market capitalization. 📊 Market capitalization is the value of all of the firm&#39;s shares. The factor&nbsp;<em>Quality</em>&nbsp;is slightly harder to capture but basically refers to screening for companies who are expected to outperform others based on their&nbsp;<em>Quality</em>. 🗑 That can be measured, for example, through low debt levels, stable earnings growth and further metrics which indicate a high quality company. &nbsp;🔝</p>\n\n<p>If you now pick a well-diversified portfolio with a focus on, let&rsquo;s say,&nbsp;<em>Value</em>&nbsp;companies, you experience the&nbsp;<em>active choice</em>&nbsp;we talked about earlier. You,&nbsp;<em>yourself</em>, pick the&nbsp;<em>selected</em>&nbsp;companies that are expected to outperform the market, making it active. 👊 The same would not apply with the macroeconomic factor&nbsp;<em>GDP growth</em>, since any company you pick would be more or less equally affected.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27868320/giphy__28_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27868320/giphy__28_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Can we see some proof of this outperformance? 🤔</strong></p>\n\n<p>The performance of several portfolios which are compared based on specific factors can be seen below. ⬇️ &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.msci.com/documents/1296102/1336482/Foundations_of_Factor_Investing.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>This graph</u></a>&nbsp;really shows how investing based on specific factors can outperform an equally weighted portfolio (aka.&nbsp;<em>the market</em>, indicated by the&nbsp;<em>purple line</em>).<br />\n<a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27867679/1629793458709.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27867679/1629793458709.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" style=\"height:334px; width:478px\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>However, the graph also reminds us that investing is not as easy as we may think. We cannot simply buy a portfolio of companies with, let&rsquo;s say, a low book-to-market ratio (factor<em>&nbsp;value</em>) and just expect to gain a large return quickly. 🤨 The point of factor investing is that outperformance based on a specific factor occurs with a&nbsp;<em>diversified</em>&nbsp;factor portfolio and over a much longer period of time. ➡️ In the short-term, many factor strategies, such as the&nbsp;<em>Minimum Volatility strategy</em>&nbsp;(the green line), can perform worse than the market. 📉</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the benefits to us impact investors?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>As just explained, factor investing means you&rsquo;re in it for the&nbsp;<em>long run</em>. 🏃&zwj;♀️ That perfectly aligns with the goals of impact investors &ndash; the incentive is not a short-term gain, but rather the creation of systematic and relevant change through your investment, alongside a financial return.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27868386/giphy__29_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27868386/giphy__29_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Through factor investing, we can also get rid of human biases we would otherwise carry into our investment process. 🎭 For example, you might invest in a specific company simply because they recently started a new marketing campaign supporting animal welfare.🐱🐶❤️ Here, factor investing can add objectivity to your investment criteria. We are not saying you should not invest in this company if it aligns with your values (we&rsquo;re all about that!). We are saying that checking out some of the metrics which capture factors such as&nbsp;<em>size</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>value</em>&nbsp;contribute to more informed decisions based on the future prospects of your investments.🧑&zwj;💻</p>\n\n<p>And, even better, factor investing and impact investing can, in many ways, complement each other! 🔀 For example, the factors&nbsp;<em>Quality</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Low&nbsp;</em><em>Volatility</em>&nbsp;are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/investment-ideas/what-is-factor-investing/factor-commentary/andrews-angle/esg-in-factors\" target=\"_blank\"><u>more strongly correlated with a better ESG profile than the market is, on average</u>.</a>&nbsp;🤝 This is because companies with more stable earnings and/or lower volatility tend to be larger companies with more experienced management and risk departments to mitigate ESG risks. Be aware, though, that this is not a free ride!🎢 Always do your own research and do not simply assume that a strong factor translates into a high ESG score or vice versa. 🤓</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27868505/giphy__30_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27868505/giphy__30_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Overall, factor investing has become a huge topic in the investment world. 🌎 We hope this article sets the foundation for your knowledge of factor investing and has inspired you to delve deeper and maybe even incorporate this strategy into your own impact investments!</p>\n\n<p>So, go ahead - be the movement and make impact! ❤️</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","a_creation":"07/09/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

These small fractions are what we call&nbsp;<em>interests</em>.💵💰</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28197367/giphy__2_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28197367/giphy__2_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s exactly this principle of simple interest that we applied to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://club.makeimpact.io/posts/scheduled/interesting-interest-rates-%F0%9F%A4%A9\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the nominal interest rate exampl</u></a><u>e</u>. 🤙So for example, consider the case where you deposit $100 into an account with a 10% annual interest rate (which isn&rsquo;t representative of the current interest rates and only serves as an explanation). If you leave the money in your account for one year, by the end of that year you will have $110 &ndash; you have earned $10 in interest. 🥰</p>\n\n<p>Nice, isn&rsquo;t it? 😃Yes, but, hey &ndash; with compound interest, we can see even greater results!🤩</p>\n\n<p><em>The compound interest&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<p>Compound interest is not the simplest concept, but we will try to introduce it as easily as possible.😵&zwj;💫 That&rsquo;s why we will not approach all its subtleties, but only its basic functioning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28197444/giphy__3_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28197444/giphy__3_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Basically, compound interest is the accumulation of interest to the principal capital and all additional deposits that were made to it. 🎢 Whew, that sounds very technical! Let&rsquo;s break it down to make it all more digestible. Principal capital is simply the money you have in your account at the beginning of period 0. 💰 Just like with the simple interest, you will earn interest each period. 💵But, of course, if you keep depositing money throughout the period, this money will also earn interest from the moment it is paid into your account. 💸At the end of the first period, the interest of the principal capital is calculated and paid to you. For the next period, you will now receive interest payments on your principal capital&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;the interest paid from the previous period. 💰💵💡</p>\n\n<p>In other words, compound interest is a way to make&nbsp;<strong>interests on interest</strong>! 📈</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28197500/giphy__4_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28197500/giphy__4_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>If this still sounds a bit confusing, don&#39;t worry! 😝 Here&rsquo;s a simple example to show you how it works:</p>\n\n<p>Consider a scenario where you&rsquo;re still investing $100, but now monthly (i.e.$1,200/year) in a deposit with a 10% annual interest and a monthly compound interval over 20 years. 👌</p>\n\n<p>That means :</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>You&rsquo;ve deposited&nbsp;<strong>$24,000&nbsp;</strong>over 20 years.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>After 20 years, you have earned&nbsp;<strong>$52,569.69</strong>&nbsp;in interest.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Finally, you are left with&nbsp;<strong>$76,569.69</strong>&nbsp;in your deposit account. &nbsp;🙀</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28197569/giphy__5_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28197569/giphy__5_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s nice, right? Yes, but the interesting thing about compound interest is that it follows an exponential curve. 👀 In our example, this means that if we increase the investment period to 40 years, you&rsquo;ll deposit double the previous amount ($48,000), but have much more than double the interest. In this case, that&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>more than 11 times</strong>&nbsp;the previous interest! 😲</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>You&rsquo;ll deposit&nbsp;<strong>$48,000 over 40 years</strong>.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>After 40 years, you have &nbsp;earned&nbsp;<strong>$589,678.02</strong>&nbsp;in interest</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Finally, you will have&nbsp;<strong>$637,678.02</strong>&nbsp;in your deposit account.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, in this example, you turn&nbsp;<strong>$48,000 into over&nbsp;<u>half a million</u>&nbsp;dollars</strong>. That&rsquo;s the power of compound interest! 😍</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28197631/giphy__6_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28197631/giphy__6_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Now, you learned the basics about interest rates and interest, about how it can help you increase your money. 🙌 Of course, we encourage you to learn more about this subject, which is finally a very interesting one &ndash; at least, we hope that&#39;s what you think now &ndash; and to start investing. 😉 Sorry, we mean to start impact investing obviously!😂</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28197669/photo-1534951009808-766178b47a4f.jpeg?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28197669/photo-1534951009808-766178b47a4f.jpeg?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n","a_creation":"12/09/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

For example, the company joined the&nbsp;<em>Consumer Goods Forum</em>&nbsp;(CGF) in 2016, aiming to stop forced labor from all global supply chains. Furthermore, Danone implemented the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.danone.com/about-danone/sustainable-value-creation.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>employee participation initiative&nbsp;<em>One Person One Voice</em></u></a>, and a unique, employee-focused board committee labelled the&nbsp;<em>Engagement Committee</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>ESG risks</h4>\n\n<p>Frankly, Danone is doing quite well in terms of ESG risks. Accordingly, they have received the rare&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.danone.com/about-danone/at-a-glance/external-recognition.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Triple-A ESG score from MSCI</u></a>. 😌 The international non-profit organization CDP also ranked Danone as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.danone.com/about-danone/at-a-glance/external-recognition.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>only one out of 10 from 5800+ companies on the A-List</u></a><u>&nbsp;</u>for the three environmental areas&nbsp;<em>climate change, forest preservation and water security</em>.

Overall, all these mechanisms suggest a functioning governance system, in which everyone is incentivised to create shared and inclusive growth. Right? 🤨</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27871320/giphy__40_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27871320/giphy__40_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Not quite, as recent scandals point out. 🙃 One piece didn&rsquo;t quite fit the puzzle: the company&rsquo;s scattered ownership structure, composed of many minority institutional investors, typically owning stakes for a few years and focusing on maximising their return on investment in that shorter span of time. 😔 These investors were unhappy about the company&rsquo;s financial performance, publicly raising their concerns and allegedly<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-danone-management-idUSKBN2BA1J6\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;<u>influencing the firing of CEO Emmanuel Faber</u></a>&nbsp;(the person who arguably embodied the stakeholder value creation model like no one else in the company). 💸💰</p>\n\n<p>The overall point is, that there seems to be a slight mismatch between the company&rsquo;s ownership structure demanding superior returns and the remaining governance mechanisms promoting stakeholder value creation at the potential expense of precisely said shareholder return. 🔀 Think about it like this: a specific employee or biodiversity initiative may be desirable, but also costly and lengthy to materialize and thus not in the interest of shorter-term institutional investors. 🥲 Striking a good balance between the interests of the company&rsquo;s most important stakeholders will be a key challenge for the new CEO.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27871341/giphy__41_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27871341/giphy__41_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>Financials</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27871131/1629802893631.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27871131/1629802893631.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" style=\"height:271px; width:602px\" title=\"Chart\" /></a><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27871129/1629802889940.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27871129/1629802889940.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" style=\"height:263px; width:602px\" title=\"Diagramm\" /></a><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27871130/1629802890833.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27871130/1629802890833.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" style=\"height:288px; width:602px\" title=\"Diagramm\" /></a><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27871128/1629802890424.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27871128/1629802890424.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" style=\"height:375px; width:602px\" title=\"Diagramm\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Through its stakeholder model and dual approach to doing business, Danone&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.danone.com/about-danone/sustainable-value-creation.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>prioritizes long-term value growth over short-term gains</u></a>. 🥰 However, the success of this mission remains questionable and the above-mentioned shareholder activism seemingly justified, as Danone&rsquo;s current share price is not much higher than 10 years ago and continuous historic EBIT growth has hardly existed&hellip;. 😲</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, competitors such as Unilever, Nestl&eacute;, Coca-Cola and Mondelez have more than doubled or tripled their respective share prices.

It&rsquo;s an abbreviation for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/2088/oj\" target=\"_blank\"><em><u>Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation</u></em></a>. ☝️ It was drafted by the European Union in 2019 and finally came into effect on March 10th 2021. The SFDRs goal is to fight greenwashing from institutional investors and asset managers, a.k.a the &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; investors in the market. 💪🪴🏢 To do so, it requires these financial market participants to transparently report on their sustainability risks and impacts, meaning that they openly have to state their influence on the environment. ✍️In this way, retail investors (i.e. the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; investors) will better be able to tell which funds are sustainable and which are not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27872000/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>How so? - Fifty shades of Green</strong></p>\n\n<p>By introducing common standards for financial firms. 😎 By outlining the requirements for all financial institutions who wish to operate within the European Union, rules are universal for everyone and ensure that&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;the companies must behave in the same way to meet the same objectives &ndash; sustainability. 🔃🙆&zwj;♀️ The regulation consists of 20 different articles that direct the future of corporate sustainability, but there are only three that are most widely known as the most important ones: Article 6, dealing with general transparency; Article 8, which classifies what is called&nbsp;&ldquo;Light Green&rdquo;&nbsp;funds; and 9) which labels&nbsp;&ldquo;Dark Green&rdquo;&nbsp;funds. 🤩</p>\n\n<p><strong>I am intrigued. Tell me more about these mythical articles...</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, it gets kind of technical here, but we&rsquo;ve got you! We&rsquo;ll list them for easier understanding:<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Article 6</strong>&nbsp;states that&nbsp;<em>al</em><em>l</em>&nbsp;financial markets participants (institutional investors and asset managers) must provide information on how&nbsp;<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/2088/oj\" target=\"_blank\"><u>ESG factors</u></a>&nbsp;have been considered in their investment decisions and their sustainable impact.🧐📖 In this way, we can say that firms must create&nbsp;<em>transparency</em>&nbsp;on their sustainable efforts (or lack thereof).😏</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27872131/giphy__1_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27872131/giphy__1_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Article 8&nbsp;</strong>is a &ldquo;level-up&rdquo; from Article 6 and marks the requirements for&nbsp;&ldquo;Light Green&rdquo; funds, which label ESG factors as one of their focus points. To meet Article 8, these funds must meet the Article 6 directives and, on top of that, provide clear information on how they meet the advertised ESG characteristics.😮&zwj;💨🤌 Furthermore, if they use an<u>&nbsp;</u><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/2088/oj\" target=\"_blank\"><u>index as a reference benchmark</u></a>, it must be shown how the fund&rsquo;s ESG factors and the index align. In this case, it must also be disclosed&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;the fund calculates such indexes. Funds that meet Article 8&rsquo;s requirements are labelled&nbsp;&ldquo;Light Green&#39;&#39; funds&nbsp;by the European Securities and Markets Authority (<a href=\"https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/jc_2021_03_joint_esas_final_report_on_rts_under_sfdr.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>ESMA</u></a>). 😎</p>\n\n<p><strong>Article 9</strong>&nbsp;marks a &ldquo;super-level-up&rdquo; and is reserved for funds and financial products focused&nbsp;<em>solely</em>&nbsp;on sustainability &ndash; we call these&nbsp;&ldquo;Dark Green&rdquo; funds. 😲 According to the SFDR, it applies where the company behind the investments provides a clear explanation on how they promote sustainability or, alternatively, where they include a&nbsp;<u>r</u><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/2088/oj\" target=\"_blank\"><u>elevant benchmark index</u></a>&nbsp;that can demonstrate the investments&rsquo; positive sustainable impact compared to the broad market. 😛 Only the funds that are consistent with Article 9 can label themselves as&nbsp;&ldquo;Dark Green&rdquo; funds. (Spoiler alert: That&rsquo;s our favorite green!)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27872238/giphy__2_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27872238/giphy__2_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Lmao ok, nerds. What does that all mean in normal English? 🤨</strong></p>\n\n<p>So, in detail, it pretty much means that companies who seek the shades-of-green labels must disclose their&nbsp;<em>sustainability risks</em>&nbsp;and, from 2022, their&nbsp;<em>principal adverse impacts</em>. 👊 Of these, sustainability risks refer to the risks that sustainability factors have on a fund&rsquo;s financial return. Principal adverse impacts, on the other hand, refers to the impacts that the fund has on, as the SFDR states, &ldquo;environmental, social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti‐corruption and anti‐bribery matters.&rdquo; 👀</p>\n\n<p>Thus, with the new SFDR, we, the investors interested in green investment funds, will know much more about whether these funds are&nbsp;<em>actually</em>&nbsp;green and sustainable, and also how their financials might be influenced by sustainability risks. 🤤</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27872300/giphy__3_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27872300/giphy__3_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Who does this apply to?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Being an EU directive, the SFDR directly applies to the financial market participants and advisors inside the European Union. This, however, does not mean that it has no impact on institutions based outside of the union. 😱 Any investment manager, European or not, who wishes to market their product to potential clients within the EU must follow the rules set out by the directive. 😮&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/portlet_file_entry/2995521/2-19052020-BP-EN.pdf/bb14f7f9-fc26-8aa1-60d4-7c2b509dda8e\" target=\"_blank\"><u>The EU comprising the third-largest economy in the world</u></a>&nbsp;(behind the US and China), it is an attractive market &ndash; therefore, it is very plausible that we&rsquo;ll also see many overseas companies disclose their sustainability risks and impacts in the near future.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27872358/giphy__4_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27872358/giphy__4_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>I guess that&rsquo;s all kind of nice&hellip; But why should&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;care?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Because with the increased transparency of green funds it seems that making sustainable investments will be a lot easier! 📈✅ One no longer has to thoroughly research the funds&rsquo; impacts on their own, but can instead trust their labels due to the new EU regulations. 📄 This saves more time for crucial activities like eating ice cream and binging Friends. 😎 It seems the SFDR and its&nbsp;<s>fifty</s>&nbsp;two shades of green are great news for sustainable portfolio diversification and, if we may say so, every impact investor&rsquo;s wet dream! 🤭</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27871845/stfdr.jpeg?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27871845/stfdr.jpeg?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n","a_creation":"16/09/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

What is its approach and how will this have a future sustainable impact? 🧐🤯These are questions one could ask. Once again, we are here to guide you and give you as much substance as possible to help you invest sustainably. 😎 To do so, we&rsquo;re going to talk about the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), which might help you figure out which questions you should ask before investing in a company. 🤪📝</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27872794/giphy__5_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27872794/giphy__5_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>What is the SASB? 🤓</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sasb.org/about/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>SASB</u></a>&nbsp;is a non-profit organization that offers ways for investors to align their investments with sustainable values. 🥰♻️ The board takes a very innovative investment approach, based on the notion that&nbsp;<em>sustainability issues are business issues</em>. For example, it is not unthinkable that less sustainable companies (like conventional oil producers) will face more problems on the business side of things due to increasing regulations. 😮 So, what has the SASB done? For one, they have developed standards to provide a new common language between companies and investors to take up sustainability issues. 😍💪</p>\n\n<p>These standards, available for 77 industries&ndash;from the pulp and paper industry to telecommunication services&ndash;identify the sustainable issues most relevant to financial performance. 📈</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27872823/giphy__6_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27872823/giphy__6_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>But why? And how does it work?</h4>\n\n<p>There is no doubt that sustainability issues can impact a company&rsquo;s financial performance. However, not all sustainability issues have the same impact on every industry. 📊 A quick example: greenhouse gas emissions do not have the same impact on a firm in the consumer goods industry as they do on a firm in the extractives and minerals processing industry. ☝️</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s why SASB standards are subdivided by industry sectors (financials, health care, etc.), where each relates to the&nbsp;<em>five dimensions of sustainability</em>, namely:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Environment;&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Social capital;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Human capital;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Business model and innovation;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Leadership and governance.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27872860/giphy__7_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/27872860/giphy__7_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Moreover, each of these sustainability dimensions are then further divided into more detailed subsets. 🔨 And, from all of these intricacies, we get the&nbsp;<strong>SASB Materiality Map</strong>&nbsp;which shows the importance (materiality) &nbsp;between the different dimensions and sectors.

Particularly, CA refers to any activity that will greatly affect a company&rsquo;s issued shares and thereby its shareholders. 🧐 Chances are, one of these shareholders could be you! ☝️ This is why you should know which CAs there are and how they will actually affect you so that you are not taken by surprise. So &ndash; let&rsquo;s jump into it! 🤾</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28237736/giphy__22_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28237736/giphy__22_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>These activities, which usually have to be approved by a company&rsquo;s Board of Directors, range from the not-so-nice matters, such as bankruptcy, to potentially more exciting topics such as acquisitions and spinoffs. 🚫💰🔃 While&nbsp;<em>mandatory</em>&nbsp;CA are automatically applied to the investments, &nbsp;there&rsquo;s a chance that shareholders like yourself have to respond to these important matters in so-called&nbsp;<em>voluntary</em>&nbsp;CA.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Important Corporate Actions 😮</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Dividends</strong></p>\n\n<p>Dividends are mandatory CA that are automatically distributed to you. 😮&zwj;💨 Basically, it means that you as a shareholder sometimes receive a little gift for your ownership, most commonly paid in cash.💸 At the same time, however, the share price is expected &ndash; at least&nbsp;<em>in theory</em>&nbsp;&ndash; to decrease by the same amount as the dividend payment to reflect that potential new shareholders after the dividend payout date do not get that same extra gift that you did. 🧐&nbsp;<a href=\"https://club.makeimpact.io/posts/what-is-a-dividend-%F0%9F%A4%9D-%F0%9F%92%BC\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Here</u></a>, you can read more about dividends and how they work. 🤩</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28237780/giphy__23_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28237780/giphy__23_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Stock Splits</strong></p>\n\n<p>Stock splits are another common mandatory CA. Let us quickly introduce how it works with a little example: Imagine you own a 100&euro; bill. 💶 Now, you trade this one bill with one of your friends who offers you two 50&euro; bills in return.💵💵 Not much has changed, right? 🤨 Not entirely true. While your absolute wealth has not changed a dime, you now hold two bills that are easier to trade and simply&nbsp;<em>more liquid</em>. 😯 We&rsquo;ve probably all come across a place that does not accept larger bills, right?</p>\n\n<p>Similar to this analogy, stock splits are often performed in order to make an individual stock more&nbsp;<em>affordable</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>liquid</em>.😋 It works like this: a company splits up its outstanding shares by a specific factor, most commonly by a 2-to-1 or 3-to-1 factor. An example? &nbsp;Sure! If you currently hold 10 shares of company X, you would hold 20 after a 2-to-1 stock split. 🤯</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand, however, that a stock split,&nbsp;<em>in theory</em>, has no impact on the company&rsquo;s market capitalization nor your wealth. 🙌 If a company doubles the number of outstanding shares, the price per share drops to half the initial price, for example, from 100&euro;/share to 50 &euro;/share and the total value of shares outstanding remains the same.🤗&nbsp;<em>In reality</em>, a stock split is often interpreted in a good way and can pave the way for further company growth, as it attracts more investors, and in turn, increases stock prices. 🤥</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28237819/giphy__24_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28237819/giphy__24_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Reverse Split</strong></p>\n\n<p>The opposite of a stock split, a reverse split is a mandatory CA often implemented by a company to artificially increase the price per share. 😌 For example, if you currently held 10 shares of X at 50&euro; each, you would hold one share at 500&euro; after a reverse split of 10-to-1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mergers and Acquisitions</strong></p>\n\n<p>Mergers and Acquisitions (M&amp;A) are another form of mandatory CA. In a&nbsp;<em>merger</em>, usually two (but sometimes even more) companies come together and merge into one larger, new company. 🙆&zwj;♀️ If the company that you are holding shares of merges, you usually, remain a shareholder after the merge. 👍 The value of your share will, however, largely depend on the financial prospects of the other company in the merger.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28237843/giphy__25_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28237843/giphy__25_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>In contrast, an&nbsp;<em>acquisition</em>&nbsp;means that the acquired company ceases to exist as a stand-alone entity. 1️⃣ &nbsp;If a company you hold shares in is acquired, you will be compensated for your shares and no longer hold any ownership of it afterwards. 😔 If your company is the acquirer, you will typically keep your shares, but, similar to a merger, the value of your share will depend on the financial prospects of the acquired company. 😛</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tender Offer</strong></p>\n\n<p>A very important voluntary CA! 😁 In a tender offer, an investor is trying to acquire parts or even all equity ownership of a company. 😲 As a potential shareholder, you are then invited to sell your shares to the bidder for a specified price within a given time frame. So, ultimately, it&rsquo;s up to you if you want to sell your shares or not. 🤯 &nbsp;Tender offers are rather attractive to existing shareholders because the offered price is usually above the current market price, but, for impact investors, one should consider who they are selling to! 🤔 If you care deeply for the company, you may want to avoid it falling into the wrong hands! 🙃</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28237865/giphy__26_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28237865/giphy__26_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>There are plenty of other Corporate Actions out there such as&nbsp;<em>rights issues, spin-offs, optional dividends</em>, and more that you continue to explore on your own. 🤪 We hope to have left you enlightened about some of the most important ones and the basic understanding that every CA substantially affects the value of shares that you are holding. 😇</p>\n\n<p>With that, there is nothing left to say, other than: Be the movement, make!mpact! 💗</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28237889/photo-1532622785990-d2c36a76f5a6.jpeg?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28237889/photo-1532622785990-d2c36a76f5a6.jpeg?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","a_creation":"23/09/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

They also use a&nbsp;<em>peer-to-peer system</em>. 🤝 This system relies on the control of the payments by the users themselves, also called&nbsp;<em>miners</em>, and by computer algorithms, the&nbsp;<em>blockchain</em>. ⛏🤖</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28198801/giphy__11_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28198801/giphy__11_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, the blockchain is like a&nbsp;<em>public ledger</em>, a collection of financial accounts. 🏦 The transactions are arranged to be carried out chronologically. 🔃 The blockchain consists of several blocks that each contains a certain number of transactions. These blocks are verified by miners before being added to the blockchain. ⛓☑️ The purpose of these checks is to avoid d<em>ouble-spending</em>.&nbsp;<em>Double-spending</em>&nbsp;means using the same money to pay for two different transactions. 🧾💵 The ledger is public, but user data is encrypted to protect anonymity. 🔒</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the &quot;miners&quot; must solve mathematical calculations, and the first one who succeeds validates the transaction and gets a transaction fee as remuneration. 🔢</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28198931/giphy__12_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28198931/giphy__12_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>What does this mean for the environment? 🤔</h4>\n\n<p>However, all these calculations demand many computers who must be working at all times, and, additionally, use energy-intensive cooling systems to cool the computers. 😔 Generally, these mining computers are grouped together in&nbsp;<em>mining farms</em>. 💻⛏The level of CO2 emissions generated by mining practices depends amongst other things on the source of the electricity. 💥 To be more profitable, miners look for the cheapest electricity. 🥲&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For example, during the rainy season in China, where about half of the world&#39;s mining farms are concentrated, there is plenty of cheap electricity from hydroelectric dams. 🌧 In some provinces, it is even sold&nbsp;<a href=\"https://actufinance.fr/actu/minage-des-cryptomonnaies-le-recours-frequent-aux-energies-renouvelables-7037293.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>30-40% cheaper than the average electricity price</u></a>. ⚡️ The concentration of miners in this area is, therefore, higher at these rainy times of the year. 📈 In the dry season, when the cost of hydropower rises, miners will switch to coal-fired power, which is cheaper but more environmentally damaging. 😭🤬</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28198978/giphy__13_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28198978/giphy__13_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Hmm&hellip;are there solutions for this? 🤨</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some stakeholders who are conscious of their ecological impact (or who wish to reduce their electricity bills) bet on green energy. 💚🔌</p>\n\n<p>This is the intention of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://leblogducoin.net/est-il-possible-de-rendre-la-crypto-durable/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em>Moonlight Project in Iceland</em></u></a>. 🇮🇸 The idea is to create a huge mining farm that relies solely on renewable energy. 💨☀️ Indeed, Iceland has the advantage of having hydroelectric and geothermal power stations, but also a cold climate, which means that the need for cooling infrastructure is reduced. 🥶❄️</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28199090/giphy__14_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28199090/giphy__14_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>For this reason, several stakeholders have chosen to establish mining farms in Iceland.

Thus, shareholders can push companies to improve their practices in the field of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)! ♻️</p>\n\n<p>Shareholder activism became increasingly popular in Europe in recent years, especially with American activist funds, which have different corporate interests than their minority shareholders and where the shareholder actions can potentially destabilise the company. 🏢🤕 These funds are often seen as a threat because they are perceived as seeking profits at the expense of long-term value creation. On the other hand, not all the funds are like this, but some are rather driven by non-financial motives (e.g. environmental, social, governance, etc.). 👀</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28743861/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28743861/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Shareholder activism is today one of the factors that influence stock prices. 📈📉 Its methods and aims differ and can be driven by either &nbsp;individual or collective interest. 👱👯 There are different tactics that shareholders use in order to become Active shareholders - from media pressure to litigation threats to forcing a conversation and bringing about change.📺📰 One specific and commonly used way to gain decisional power by acquiring voting rights in a listed company is&nbsp;<em>short-selling</em>. 💰 But let&rsquo;s look a little bit closer at that!</p>\n\n<h4>Short-selling&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p><em>Short-selling&nbsp;</em>campaigns are characterised by activist funds or activist investors taking a short position on a target company. 🎯&nbsp;<em>Taking a short position</em>&nbsp;simply means that the investors first borrows and then sells the shares of the company, with the goal of buying the shares later at a lower price to make more profit.🤑💲 They basically bet on a decrease of the share price in the hopes of earning a lot of money. Some countries like Malaysia see this practice as&nbsp;<em>speculative</em>&nbsp;and therefore do not allow it. 🙅 Those funds take huge risks when selling a stock short, because they can lose a huge amount of money!🤧 We know that this sounds very theoretical and complex, but don&#39;t frown.

A share is like any other object priced and traded in a market, just like shirts! 👚👕 Imagine that you think the price of a make!mpact shirt is going to fall, so you want to bet on the possible fall. 🤔 Because of this you ask a friend of yours who owns one of the shirts to lend them to you. 🤝 You then sell the shirt at the current price - &nbsp;let&rsquo;s say at &euro;200 - then when the price has actually fallen, you buy them back - let&rsquo;s say at &euro;150 - and give them back to your friend. In the end, you will have earned &euro;50.💵 &nbsp;Easy right?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28743969/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28743969/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>Don&rsquo;t be fooled by active funds</h4>\n\n<p>Likewise,&nbsp;<em>active funds</em>&nbsp;bet on the f<em>all of the stock price</em>&nbsp;of a target company so as to either to change its management or gain a profit. 📉 Funds that have the latter purpose will choose dubious listed companies - e.g. suspected of fraud, financial malpractice, misrepresentation or deficient business models - as their targets and conduct an in-depth investigation of the companies&rsquo; financials and operations before selling short. 🕵️&zwj;♀️ Once the stock&rsquo;s overvaluation is detected and well &nbsp;documented - e.g. by publishing a report - the fund will short-sell shares in the company and seek to convince other investors to do the same. 📰 If the fund is convincing enough and everyone ends up selling the stock, the share price has fallen . The activist fund has &ldquo;won&rdquo; because it has bet on the share price falling and therefore made a profit. 😈</p>\n\n<p>An example for such an activist fund would be Muddy Waters Research. It is best known for publishing a report on Sino-Forest Corp, a Chinese company listed in Canada. 🇨🇳🇨🇦 The report claimed that Sino-Forest had fraudulently inflated its assets and earnings, and that the company&#39;s shares were essentially worthless.😵❌ Sino-Forest&#39;s shares fell 82% after the Muddy Waters&rsquo; report was published and the company went bankrupt. It is unclear whether Muddy Waters is a whistleblower or illegally manipulating prices. 🤥✍️ The financial authorities have not ruled on the issue despite strong suspicions about the hedge fund.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28744026/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28744026/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>As we have mentioned already in &nbsp;the beginning, there is another growing practice to improve companies&#39; ESG practices:&nbsp;<em>shareholder engagement</em>. 🤩</p>\n\n<h4>Shareholder engagement or campaigns to raise the extra-financial value of an issuer</h4>\n\n<p>Through their&nbsp;<em>engagement,</em>&nbsp;shareholders seek to promote greater corporate transparency and/or the application of more honorable policies. 🥰</p>\n\n<p>The investor practicing shareholder engagement can use one or more levers of influence to induce a company&#39;s transformation over the long term. 🔃&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/riftapp.fr/rift-engagement-actionnarial-un-levier-daction-sous-estim?e=1076331064\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Here are some of the tactics</u></a>:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Direct dialogue with the company&#39;s management&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Voting at annual general meetings (AGMs) that bring together managers, employees, partners and shareholders</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Public communication with the media on the inadequacies in the governance and operation of a company</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Legal action with the help of shareholder advocacy groups</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Informal lobbying of board members, employees, partners and/or other shareholders to build coalitions</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Impact on management, ranging from freezing positions to divestment</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28744094/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28744094/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Even if &nbsp;things are changing, resolutions that try to respond to the current ecological and ethical issues do not get enough favourable votes in most cases. 😔</p>\n\n<p>Shareholder engagement could become a real tool to deeply transform the economic model of large companies, but this practice would require minority shareholders to come together and push those changes forward for their common interest. 🙏🏼✊ Let this inspire you and go make the most out of your voting rights and become and active shareholder. 😛 Till next time - Be the movement.

The Match Group, on the other hand, is more mature, listed since 2015, and trades at 73x multiples. 👀 But a significant difference is Bumble&rsquo;s profit margin, which is almost double to Match Group&rsquo;s profit margin and implies that operations and resources are spent much more efficiently and that costs are well-minimized. 😍 Overall, one needs to be aware that the Dating App industry is very easy-to-enter and highly competitive. 🤕</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28743447/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28743447/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>While empowering women is embroidered into Bumble&rsquo;s mission and set-up, it is questionable if this can effectively lead to more equal outcomes in heterosexual relationships. 😬 The company&#39;s actions seem to live up to the values of integrity and respect that it aims to promote through its platforms and services - focusing on the support of women victims of sexual harassment and committing to achieving carbon neutrality by 2025. 👍❤️ Financially, the company has not reached maturity yet. Despite its sustained revenue growth and focus on expanding heavily, Bumble belongs to the Dating Apps Industry with many players and whose competitive landscape is hard to predict. 📊</p>\n\n<p>Who knows what the Dating App industry will look like 10 years from now? 🤷 We will support Bumble&#39;s effort and swipe right on this investment. 👉 Of course, don&rsquo;t forget to do your own research and build your own opinion.

Today, you might know this as the Internet. 🖥💾</p>\n\n<p>By only mentioning the word&nbsp;<em>Internet</em>, we allude to a little known world with such a rich history. And in this huge world the search engines take one of the most important places. 🔎🤖Whether you use them at your job, at home or even on your smartphone, search engines are inevitable for almost all internet users to find to the numerous websites you use on a daily basis. But do you know about the impact search engines can have? 🤔 Then let us find out&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28828286/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28828286/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>So, what is a search engine? 🤗</h4>\n\n<p>You probably use a search engine, sometimes even several, and you probably have just used one to arrive at this article, but maybe it never occurred to you to know what it actually is. 😬</p>\n\n<p>To break it down, a search engine is a software developed to execute search on the web. This means that before search engines, the only way to access a website was to type its URL. ✍️😫 Well yes, you know that thing:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.iamanexample.com/a_complex_one/1Zp1kwWb1yq1DAz\" target=\"_blank\"><u>www.iamanexample.com/a_complex_one</u></a><u>/</u>. But if you did not know the exact URL, there was no chance to arrive at your desired destination&hellip;.🤯 So, fortunately now we only need to search&nbsp;<em>Iamanexample</em>&nbsp;on a search engine as Google, Yahoo, Bing, Qwant, Baidu&hellip; &nbsp;and it suggests options which include this text (or alike texts) and help you access the wanted website. 😍🎉 Simple, efficient: perfect!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28828327/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28828327/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Got it.. but how do they make money? 💸</h4>\n\n<p>There are a few ways a search engine can make money. The Search engines mainly make money with&nbsp;<em>advertisements</em>.💲🚩 For search results, this entails that certain websites will be shown higher in peoples results either by showing the websites as specifically labelled advertisement or as belonging to your results. #️⃣ However, they also make money from<a href=\"https://www.mequoda.com/articles/audience-development/5-different-types-of-search-engines-how-they-make-money/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>&nbsp;selling the Data they collect from marketing and consumer habits</u></a>. 😮&zwj;💨 You were probably asked before to enable certain &ldquo;Cookies&rdquo;. 🍪Cookies are data files which are supposed to improve your online experience by saving&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/cookies\" target=\"_blank\"><u>information of your browsing experience to tailor the content better to you</u></a>.💾 Often, this data is analyzed and will be sold to third parties.📲 This can be problematic, because if not done safely enough it can be a real harm to the customers privacy. 😳</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28828345/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28828345/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Big technologies require lots of energy 📈</h4>\n\n<p>As you can probably assume, the computers needed for those search engines are very complex and running the processes at the&nbsp;<em>data centers requires lots of energy</em>.🔋 To make it more visual to you, did you know that every time you look something up on google, the same energy could be used to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/green/2020/04/27/google-makes-140-billion-a-year-from-ads-could-green-search-engines-invest-this-more-ethic\" target=\"_blank\"><u>light up a 60 watt light bulb for 17 seconds</u></a>?! 💡Just imagine, how many searches you conduct on a daily basis. We bet that your lightbulb would be shining all day...🔆⚠️However, also a big difference in energy consumption depends on the time spent on one single search. The longer the search - a.k.a. the inquiry - takes, the more energy is consumed and the bigger is the carbondixodie consumption! 📈 Therefore, it is best to use a quick search engine or even better: simply&nbsp;<a href=\"https://greenspector.com/en/search-engines/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>type in the URL by yourself</u></a>&nbsp;without using a search engine.☝️</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28828500/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28828500/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Alternative Search Engines 👀</h4>\n\n<p>After reading all of this, you might be traumatised and not able to use a search engine ever again. 😨We have some good news for you. There are some search engines which focus on solving those issues and try to contribute to society and the environment. 🤩🥳 Here are some of our favorites:</p>\n\n<p><em>Ecosia&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<p>Ecosia uses renewable sources to power its data centers. ♻️ For this, they even build their own solar plants instead of using external sources to provide them.🔆 On top of that: they use their profits to plant trees and reduce the carbon impact created with their searches due to their browser. 🌳🌲</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28828519/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28828519/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>Qwant</em></p>\n\n<p>If you are very concerned about the storage of your data, then Qwant might be an option to try for you. 🕵️&zwj;♀️ They do not track your data and therefore do not sell it to third-parties. 🙌 They make their money from advertisements which are generated with the help of the Microsoft Bing ad network.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>Ekoru</em></p>\n\n<p>Ekoru donates&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/alternative-search-engines-social-good/338817/#close\" target=\"_blank\"><u>60% of their income to different charities</u></a>. Those charities aim at different goals like reforestation, climate action, animal welfare etc. 🤝 Just like Ecosia, they use renewable resources to power its searches. ☀️💨 🌊 And even better - they do not save any search related data on their servers to protect privacy. The only pitfall is that this search engine is currently not available all over the world. 🌎😔</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28828534/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28828534/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>GiveWater</em></p>\n\n<p>GiveWater aims at improving water situations and sanitation all over the world. 💧 Just like Ekoru, search results are powered through Bing and they make money from advertisements. It is a non-profit company and considers &nbsp;themselves a social impact search engine.💪</p>\n\n<h4>How efficient are competitors?&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>If you are still not convinced of switching in the fear that all your comfort of using your current search engine will be gone, let us give you another reason.🗣 As we mentioned earlier, most alternative search engines use the Microsoft Bing ad network for their searches. Studies have shown that people&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.2210.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>perceive the relevance of the results as about the same</u></a>&nbsp;compared to the biggest competitor google.🤙 So, this means that there will be no significant loss in comfort and additionally by switching you do good for the world! 🥰</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28828559/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28828559/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Have you changed your search engine yet?🤪 If not, it is time to find a search engine that fights those world problems that keep you up at night and use it.😎 It is a simple way &nbsp;to contribute to a better world.

Cheap Airlines like Ryanair or Eurowings offer prices, which might even be cheaper than buying a pizza. ✈️🍕 Sounds like a great way to get the most out of your money! 🤑 But now you might be asking yourself what the catch is here? Well, the costs do not reflect the true price of the product or service. 🤕 But, let us better explain what true pricing means!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28829203/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28829203/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>True prices are based on true costs</h4>\n\n<p>Before starting to look at true prices, we have to understand the concept of true costs. The&nbsp;<em>true cost</em>&nbsp;of a product entails not only the &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; costs - see transport or materials - but shall also take into account &nbsp;<em>social and environmental costs</em>&nbsp; such as underpayment of labour, greenhouse emissions, and declining biodiversity.🛠📦💨 Those not accounted-for costs are also referred to as&nbsp;<em>negative-externalities</em>. 🤭</p>\n\n<p>You might be wondering what the problem with those negative-externalities is? Right, the problem with true costs is that the current consumers or producers do not pay them, but they are being pushed onto future generations, taxpayers or even other individuals among the value chain.🔜 So, they are not accounted for in the product! 🤥</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28829221/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28829221/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Okay&hellip; but what is the true price of a product now?!</h4>\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<em>true price</em>&nbsp;of a product includes the<a href=\"https://truepricefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/True-Price-A-roadmap-for-true-pricing-v1.0-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;<u>true costs and the market price</u></a>.🙌 This means that not only internal factors for the product are considered but also external factors. So, imagine that when you buy a banana, the price consists of the price you would usually pay and additional costs to improve negative externalities. 📈</p>\n\n<p>To help you understand this a little bit better, let us look at an example. So, you buy a make!mpact pen for 5&euro; in the store. 💵 But that is not the true price for the pen because it does not take into account the CO2 emission, the water pollution and &nbsp;accident insurance for the workers that occur during the production process. 🚱☠️⛽️ To balance out the negative externalities caused by this pen, you have to pay 1&euro; for the CO2 emission compensation, 0,5&euro; for the water pollution and 0,5 &euro; for workers&rsquo; insurance. 💪 Overall, the true price for this pen would now be 7&euro;, instead of just 5&euro;. The difference between those prices, the 2 &euro; for external costs, is also known as the true-price gap. 😍 Seems simple!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28829242/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28829242/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>And how do you determine the true price of a product?</h4>\n\n<p>There are several different methods on how to determine the true price of a product. 📝🔄 One of them is the right-based approach which takes into account a set of commonly used laws and regulations like the Declaration of human rights.⚖️📔 The organization behind the true price, the true price foundation, states that all companies should follow those set rules even when they legally do not have to. ☝️ Then, it should be considered which negative externalities take place due to the purchase of this product and how to quantify the prices for those externalities.📊 For this purpose, methods such as life-cycle assessment can be used. 🎢 And after we know the extent of the negative externality, we can value and convert the negative externality into a monetary value. 💴 This then should include both&nbsp;<a href=\"https://truepricefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/True-Price-A-roadmap-for-true-pricing-v1.0-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>restoration and compensation costs</u>&nbsp;</a>for the negative externality.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28829272/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28829272/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Why is this not the norm?</h4>\n\n<p>If you are now wondering why we do not already do this for all products, you have to know that there are problems in our current market according to the true price foundation. 😬 Firstly, the market does not give any incentives to include those costs. 🛒 Secondly, remediation, giving back to the hurt causes, is on our market not done often and often hard to do. And lastly, there is no transparency on the true costs.🥸 This means that the true costs have to be identified and where they come from, which many companies do not want to disclose. 📃 More stringent regulation for example when it comes to greenhouse emissions ceilings, is already spurting companies to cut on those externalities or compensate for those. However, supply chains are so globally widespread that some externalities risk not being priced in, especially in countries where labour rights are not legally enforced. 🚓🚨 Therefore, it is up to us consumers to be critical about ESGs-impact of the products and services we purchase while not getting hyped suspiciously low-priced products.☝️ And also, the acceptance to pay the true price amongst the consumers is not there yet, as most customers prefer to pay less, rather than the true costs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28829299/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28829299/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Is there anyone who actually uses it?</h4>\n\n<p>Yes! There are some companies which already use the true costs to price their products. 😍 An example of this is the german supermarket chain&nbsp;<em>Penny</em>&nbsp;which for an assortment of products increased their prices and showed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.rewe-group.com/en/press-and-media/newsroom/press-releases/penny-labels-its-first-products-with-true-prices/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>difference in conventional and true prices</u></a>. 👍 Also, there are some firms which are transparent about their production and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.marques-de-france.fr/quel-est-le-prix-juste-dun-vetement-quel-est-le-cout-du-made-in-france/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>show how they calculate the true price of their products</u></a>. 🧮</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Now you know what the true price of a product is! Maybe you can consider all those influences on the product next time you think about buying something. Be the movement!

The&nbsp;<em>pandemic</em>&nbsp;has created irreversible changes not only to enterprises but also to educational institutions.🔀 From 2020 the e-learning market is expected to grow at a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://campustechnology.com/articles/2021/06/09/elearning-market-to-reach-1-trillion-within-6-years.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"><u>compound annual rate of 21% percent until 2027</u></a>&nbsp;and hit 1 trillion dollars! 📈</p>\n\n<p>2. Economic disruption and the need to&nbsp;<em>develop skills for a digital future&nbsp;</em>lead people to learn online.🖥 Skills that were valued just three years ago may no longer be relevant and therefore there is a need for constant training and updating of knowledge. 🏋️&zwj;♀️</p>\n\n<p>3. And there is a&nbsp;<em>shift in employers&#39; demand.</em>&nbsp; Employers no longer just look at degrees but skills - e.g. see the case of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/provocate/you-dont-need-college-anymore-says-google-102d4beec668\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Google hiring criteria</u></a>&nbsp;- and this is exactly where platforms like Coursera play in, though offering new professional career certificates. 👀🎫 &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28829510/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28829510/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>Sustainable Development Goals&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>Coursera&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://about.coursera.org/press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Coursera-Impact-Report-2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Impact Report 2020</u></a><u>&nbsp;</u>gives a good overview of their contribution towards the SDGs.

IBMs), in particular with respect to the&nbsp;<em>Quality and Continuous Improvement, Educational Outcomes, Privacy and Consumer Protection</em>&nbsp;of its Business Model. 😍Differently, when it comes to Community factors, the overall score is only 25%, with particularly low rates in&nbsp;<em>Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion, Economic Impact</em>&nbsp;(6%),&nbsp;<em>Civic Engagement &amp; Giving, Supply Chain Management&nbsp;</em>(4%, the lowest). 😐</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28829987/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28829987/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><em>Governance factors:</em></p>\n\n<p>This Impact Area includes&nbsp;<em>Mission &amp; Engagement</em>&nbsp; and&nbsp;<em>Ethics &amp; Transparency&nbsp;</em>- both relating to the company&rsquo;s operations.

Since the IPO, its market price seems to have trended downwards. 📉</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/36995444/1648035301960.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/36995444/1648035301960.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/36995464/1648035343006.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/36995464/1648035343006.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>In the last four years, &nbsp;EBIT has resulted in a loss over and this has continued for the first and second quarter in 2021.1️⃣2️⃣ In 2020, Coursera has registered an unprecedented growth in revenues and customers. The exceptional growth was mainly caused by the&nbsp;<em>pandemic-induced&nbsp;</em><em>mega trend of online education</em>.💥 Coursera expects to continue growing, however, at a much lower rate than 2020. The company&#39;s 2021 full-year outlook calls for about a 26% growth in revenue, which is good, but a far cry from 2020&rsquo;s 58% growth.📊 The company will continue to &ldquo;incur significant expense in technology and content development to launch a new offering or program&rdquo; as a strategy to&nbsp;<em>increase customer retention and expansion</em>. In this regard, the company has spent 69% of its gross profit in marketing operations in 2020. 💲💲</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/36996042/1648036328310.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/36996042/1648036328310.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/36996094/1648036393402.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/36996094/1648036393402.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Currently, most of the company&#39;s revenue and gross profit come from the people buying certificates.🔖 Coursera&#39;s degree segment, where they collaborate with universities, is all profit since course content is provided by the educational institution👩&zwj;🎓🏫. The expansion of the degree offer may attract brand-new customers and be a compelling source of revenue growth for the future.</p>\n\n<p>Coursera classifies as a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). When it comes to competitors we find that: some are still currently privately-owned (see Udemy, Udacity etc.), some are no-profit (see EdX, Khan Academy) while some belong to major listed groups (see LinkedIn Learning, delisted and acquired by Microsoft in 2016). 📜😵&zwj;💫Therefore, as a comparison, we choose the only somewhat closely listed company Duolingo, an e-learning platform focusing on the learning of languages and also just gone public in July 2021. 🤓</p>\n\n<p>When compared with the latter, Coursera&#39;s multiples don&rsquo;t give evidence of over-valuation if compared as well as it shows a relatively low D/E ratio, 3.05 (vs Duolingo&rsquo;s 9.50). &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28830041/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/28830041/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n\n<p>All right, to sum up, all of this information: Coursera is among the market leaders in the MOOC industry and through free-access to quality content worldwide allows people from all backgrounds to build relevant skills and knowledge to unlock new opportunities leading to a better life, especially in the least developed countries. 🏆🤝 Some SDGs easily fit into the company&#39;s mission, especially regarding social and governance factors. Its environmental factors need some severe improvement. 😱 Especially, as there is no information about the source of energies used to run its operations. Despite the lack of profitability, the company is financially sound. 🤌 Growth in revenues is to stabilize after the pandemic but might still benefit from the 2-digit growth of the e-learning sector, forecasted &nbsp;for the next 5 years. 📈</p>\n\n<p>The challenge for the company will be to invest in new content and programs relevant to users and for which the latter are willing to pay for as well as cope with a densely competitive market. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We hope that you gained some helpful insights about Coursera and its position on the market. Hopefully, this inspired you to learn more and support some good projects. 📕Remember, to always do your own research.

You might now wonder why people specifically use the terms Bull and Bear?🤔 Well, we do not know that either. 🤷&zwj;♀️&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.robinhood.com/articles/3i6hIwhY75uWjZUZiLFTFT/what-are-bull-and-bear-markets/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>There are some hypotheses about this</u></a>, like linking it to the animal&rsquo;s natural movements or referring it to the purchases of the animal&#39;s skins, but nobody really knows this for a fact.😬</p>\n\n<h2>What does the Bull represent? 🐮</h2>\n\n<p>A bull market, or when a market<em>&nbsp;is bullish</em>, generally means that there is growth within the market in terms of an increase or that you see growth potential. 📈 There are no specific metrics for a bullish market, however, the rule of thumb is, that a market can be considered a&nbsp;<em>bull market</em>&nbsp;when there is a 20% increase from the lowest point. ☝️ Not only can a market be a bull market, but you can also use this term to explain stocks, charts, or anything that your heart desires. 🤓</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/30764208/giphy-19.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/30764208/giphy-19.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>An example of a bull market would be the boom of the post-war economy in the 1950s.

Additionally, the 20% decrease rule of thumb usually applies from the peak moment. When you see a drop coming, you can also say that the market will be bearish. 👌</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/30764231/giphy-20.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/30764231/giphy-20.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After a&nbsp;<em>boom</em>, there usually comes a phase of recession.

The opposite is called deflation.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/30762439/giphy2.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/30762439/giphy2.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h2>Why it happens</h2>\n\n<p>There are three causes of inflation.</p>\n\n<p>1. When&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/p/c6521511ee25/edit\" target=\"_blank\"><u>demand for goods and services is higher than supply</u></a>, suppliers will increase their prices, and if buyers are willing to pay more, it&rsquo;s known as demand-pull inflation.🤑💲</p>\n\n<p>2. When the costs to produce a good or service increase, in order to cover their costs suppliers will increase their prices, known as cost-push inflation. 👆</p>\n\n<p>3. When the price of goods and services goes up, wages accordingly go up, and the cost to a business goes up which means the prices must go up enough to cover this additional increase, like a loop. 🔁 This is referred to as built-in inflation.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, stable and steady inflation is a sign of a healthy economy, since markets are growing and wages are increasing. 💪 It is when the economy grows rapidly and excessively (hyperinflation), or when the prices of goods and services decrease (deflation) that may cause concerns.👀</p>\n\n<h2>How it affects your investment</h2>\n\n<p>As a new investor, you need to be aware of inflation for a couple of reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, since the value of cash and money in the bank decreases when it&rsquo;s just sitting there, over time you can buy less for the same amount of money. 😰 This is a good reason to invest your money. 😎 Money in the stock market tends to follow the trends of inflation, although returns on investment are never guaranteed so it depends on your personal financial strategy.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, if you invest in industries and markets that are on the rise, and things continue to increase, your investment will likely benefit from inflation. 🥰</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/30762483/giphy3.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/30762483/giphy3.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h2>For example&hellip;</h2>\n\n<p>Person X is passionate about reducing carbon emissions, so they invest in the renewable energy industry. ♻️ If more people continue to become aware of the benefits of switching from coal to green energy, there will be more demand for these services. ☝️ As demand increases, suppliers will increase their costs (demand-pull inflation) so as the cost of renewable energy will go up, businesses in the industry will increase their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/p/bd1bc2a39c32/edit\" target=\"_blank\"><u>profits</u></a>&nbsp;and over time, the value of Person X&rsquo;s investments will also increase.📈💵</p>\n\n<p>Since you start investing with just 100&euro;, the next time your Grandma gives you birthday money, you could consider investing it rather than keeping it in the bank. 🏦🎁 This is it from us for now.

Thus, your bank can only invest the money in your checking account in the very short term, and therefore in fossil fuels. 🥴</p>\n\n<p>And this is a pity because our money is a very important lever for the ecological transition. ❗️There should be more pressure on banks to disinvest in fossil fuels and reallocate their capital to more impactful projects.

So, you tell your friend not to worry, that you will return it to him in a few months. ☝️ You then sell the stock at the current price - let&#39;s say 200&euro;. 3 months later, the price of the stock is only worth 150&euro;, and as promised, you decide to give it back to your buddy. 😌 You buy another at the current price of 150&euro;. So, after giving it back you won 48&euro; (=200&euro;-2&euro;-150&euro;)! 😍 Easy, isn&#39;t it?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/30763034/giphy-14.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/30763034/giphy-14.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Ok and now imagine, that you have made a mistake in your bet and that the stock after 3 months is not worth the expected 150&euro; but instead 500&euro;. Meaning, that what you sold for i.e. 200&euro;, you now have to buy back for 500&euro; because you need to give it back to your friend. 🥲 Ouch, it hurts, because you lose 302&euro;. 😤</p>\n\n<p>You might now wonder: &ldquo;But as long as I haven&rsquo;t bought the stock back, I haven&#39;t lost any money yet, right? &nbsp;I can always wait for the price to go down and return it to him later.&rdquo; 🤥</p>\n\n<p>If the stock increases in value, you must pay &ldquo;margin call&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s the difference between the current price and the price when you have shorted.📊 It&rsquo;s just to adjust the price for the broker (your friends) and to prove you have enough money.

And long-term investors can bring interest to buy the stock, so the price continues to increase.🔺</p>\n\n<p>Thus, a real tug-of-war took place between REDDIT&#39;s retail investors and the hedge funds. 🤛 Although the share price reached more than $300 at the end of January - which is completely overvalued for a company that is breaking up like GameStop - the majority of the retail investors stayed in their positions and decided not to sell in order to make the hedge funds lose money. 😈</p>\n\n<p>Thus, in a short squeeze, the hedge funds that are in a short position are fighting each other to buy a quantity of stock that is not enough for everyone. 🤒</p>\n\n<p>If they can&#39;t get their hands on shares to unwind their positions, they have to pay excessive margin calls.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/30763100/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/30763100/giphy.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Note that we don&#39;t know if there was really a short squeeze, it&#39;s very difficult to determine but in any case, it was REDDIT&#39;s will.</p>\n\n<p>Now you know more about short selling and the GameStop story! 📕 However, the story here is a summary, and we did not talk about the link between REDDIT&#39;s retail investment platform and the parent company of Melvin Capital.

Yay! 🎉</p>\n\n<h2>A look into the future of renewable energy&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Over the next 5 years, the production costs of photovoltaic and wind energy (onshore) are expected to decrease by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.quiestvert.fr/contenus/actualites/quel-avenir-pour-les-energies-renouvelables-dici-2025/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>36% and 15%</u></a>, respectively while the electricity production capacity from wind and photovoltaic is expected to double by 2025.⬇️ Off-shore wind currently represents a small share of the wind-production capacity but that also has very promising prospects. 🌊🌊</p>\n\n<p>More globally, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.iea.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>IEA</u></a>&nbsp;(International Energy Agency) estimates that 95% of the increase in total global energy capacity by 2025 will come from renewable sources. &nbsp;Renewables are the future of the energy sector! 🙌</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/32307170/giphy__1_.webp?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/32307170/giphy__1_.webp?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h2>Overcoming obstacles with energy storage</h2>\n\n<p>As said before, the main problem with renewable energies is their intermittency. 😰 The solution would be to store this energy in order to have a reserve when demand increases. While it used to be a major obstacle for the expansion of renewables a few years ago, today energy storage is becoming one of the fastest-growing asset classes in the energy industry. 📈</p>\n\n<p>New batteries and technologies are being developed, such as thermodynamic solar power plants.🧑&zwj;🔬 Here, the sun&#39;s energy is highly concentrated and then stored as heat by a special liquid. This is then easy to manipulate: that heat can be used to generate electricity at any time, even at night in the middle of winter. ⛄</p>\n\n<p>There is also a lot of R&amp;D &nbsp;at the moment about hydrogen as a means to store surplus energy from renewables. 🔜 Researchers are even working on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.airbus.com/newsroom/stories/hydrogen-aviation-understanding-challenges-to-widespread-adoption.html\" target=\"_blank\">h<u>ydrogen-based solutions</u>&nbsp;to power airplanes</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/32307221/giphy__2_.webp?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/32307221/giphy__2_.webp?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h2>Is investing in renewable energy a good idea❓</h2>\n\n<p>Renewable energy companies, which include wind, biomass, solar, thermal, hydrogen, and hydro, are constantly growing. &ldquo;Green&rdquo; electricity is therefore becoming a buoyant sector and above all a very dynamic market, which could find a place of choice in your investor&#39;s portfolio. 💰</p>\n\n<p>A few years ago, investments in renewable energy companies were considered rather risky... but today, this is no longer the case. Green energy investment products have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fool.ca/2021/09/18/renewable-energy-options-for-every-portfolio/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>become increasingly profitable</u></a>! ♻️😍</p>\n\n<p>As governments and corporations recognize the need for a transition to renewable energy, the opportunities for investing in renewables stocks grow along. 💪 Renewable energy investments are characterized by long-term contracts and are meant to last for decades. This means for investors a longer horizon for attractive returns! 📆</p>\n\n<p>In addition to giving purpose to your savings by actively participating in the ecological transition, you will likely also benefit from the financial opportunities of a growing market! 😍 Remember - &nbsp;be the movement and makeimpact! ❤️</p>\n","a_creation":"28/12/2021","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

It is about creating, prolonging, or slowing down a recurring loop: Waste is now a raw material to be reused. 🚱 So, you try to make the most out of your already existing products! 😍</p>\n\n<p>It is the opposite of the linear economy, also known as &quot;extract, produce, consume, throw away&quot;, which is also the model used in most societies. 🏙</p>\n\n<h2>What kind of ways are there to push forward the circular economy? 🤔</h2>\n\n<p>The idea of circularity can kick in throughout the different stages of a product&#39;s lifecycle<a href=\"https://blog.recommerce.com/green-circle/reconditionne/economie-circulaire-exemple/\" target=\"_blank\">.</a>&nbsp;🔵 Let&rsquo;s see how:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/32357734/1639496598906.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" style=\"height:305px; width:327px\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Design &amp; Manufacture&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>At the product design stage, it is all about facilitating the repairing, the disassembling, and the recycling. The goal is to extend the object&#39;s life and facilitate the recovery of materials. 🪡🧶</p>\n\n<p>The choice of raw materials is also essential. Some raw materials require a lot of resources to be extracted. 😨 In addition, some production inputs such as rare minerals are extracted in conflict zones or countries that do not respect human rights (dangerous working conditions, child labor, poverty wages, etc.). 🥴 Therefore, the reuse of extracted materials comes as a strategy to reduce both environmental damage and the risk of modern slavery. 🌳🛠</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/32358042/giphy__16_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Distribution &amp; Retailer&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Which means of transportation to use? 🚚🛳 Home delivery or store delivery? Which container? Which packaging? 📦 There is no universal answer while each company should think of the most sustainable solutions among the viable options.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.novethic.fr/actualite/environnement/economie-circulaire/isr-rse/developppement-durable-comment-interface-revolutionne-son-modele-industriel-143173.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>For example</u></a>: Imagine a company that sells cosmetic oils and wonders which shipping container is the most ecological. You might think they should use glass bottles since glass can be reused and recycled for an infinite amount of time. 🥛😎 But look, when using glass containers the shipment will be heavier and require more fuel than if plastic containers are used. 😮&zwj;💨 On the other hand, when choosing plastic containers, concerns may arise about their lifespan and chance to recycle the material at the end of their lives. Depending on the parameters, the environmental impact of plastic can be better than glass and vice versa.🥴 Through life-cycle assessment analysis and tools, the company can calculate the environmental impact of each solution and adopt the most eco-friendly. 🤙</p>\n\n<h2>Consumption 🍴</h2>\n\n<p>On the buyer&#39;s side, we consumers shall consume responsibly. You certainly don&#39;t need to change your phone every time a new model comes out! 📵</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/32358079/giphy__17_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>\n\n<h2>Maximize Use - Repair &amp; Reuse</h2>\n\n<p>Extending the lifetime of a product entails repairing it as much as possible or selling it if it is not used. 🪛🔨</p>\n\n<p>We can also think about an economic model based on use over possession: the sharing economy. 🫂</p>\n\n<p>Here an example could be that if you don&#39;t need to use a car every day, instead of buying one, you can just rent one or carpool. 🚗 This maximizes the use of existing products and spares resources from producing one for every single user. This concept can apply to other less conventional categories too like a lawn mower or a raclette machine jointly bought with your neighbors! 🥸</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/32358113/giphy__18_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>\n\n<h2>Recycling &amp; Reprocessor&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>The aim here is to look for alternatives to landfills or incineration. ♻️ Circular economy companies process their waste according to the following scheme: If the first solution is not possible, they consider the next and so on.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADJvT1_lr1I\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Here are some questions to ask yourself</u></a><u>&nbsp;</u>when trying to extend a product&#39;s life ✅:</p>\n\n<p><em>1) Reuse</em>: Is it possible to reuse the object as is?</p>\n\n<p><em>2) Upcycling:</em>&nbsp;Is it possible to transform the object into a new product, adding a strong added value?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>3) Composting &amp; Recycling: If there are organic materials they will be composted. And if they are not, is it also possible to recycle them?</p>\n\n<p><em>4) Energy recovery:&nbsp;</em>As the last resort, they will turn to incineration, which generates heat by burning the non-reusable materials. So, is it possible to use the product for energy?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/32358373/giphy__19_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>\n\n<h2>Are there problems with the circular economy? 🤔</h2>\n\n<p>However, not everything that shines is gold. 🏆&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.caminteresse.fr/economie-societe/economie-circulaire-gare-aux-solutions-trop-faciles-11171076/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Lucie Domingo</u></a>&nbsp;warns us against the too-easy solutions that the circular economy can present. 😳</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, the surplus of waste and the depletion of resources are two major problems of our century, but they are not the only ones! The risk with the circular economy is that we forget about the other less visible challenges of our century such as global warming and the loss of biodiversity, which cannot be solved with this type of economic model. 🥵 Moreover, she found, we only partially question the use of the eco-designed objects. 😯 We often forget their maintenance, their transport, or their usefulness for the society and the individuals who compose it. ☹️</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s take the example of water bottles: Does consuming recycled plastic water bottles on a daily basis really address the issues surrounding plastic? Shouldn&#39;t we question the utility of plastic bottles in general? Can&#39;t we drink tap water directly and get a water bottle for our trips? 🤯</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/32358471/giphy__20_.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>\n\n<p>Essentially, Domingo says that the urgency of the environmental crisis needs a fundamental change in our industrial activities and our daily lives. 🏭🚫 The risk is to act too quickly! The focus on immediate and less effective solutions may mislead the realizations of the solutions on the long term. 😶&zwj;🌫️&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As you might have realized circularity and sustainability matters at large are complex but remember, always strive to be the movement and make!mpact! 💚</p>\n","a_creation":"04/01/2022","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

You can change the reference period from 1D (i.e 1 day) to MAX (i.e. the entire lifetime of the stock). 📊</p>\n\n<p>This type of stock market graph is called a continuous curve. It is quite easy to understand! 😻 The x-curve represents time, the y-curve represents the closing price of the stock. Thus, the curve symbolizes the price at which the stock was trading at the end of the trading day (closing price) at each point in time for a given period. 💵💵💵</p>\n\n<p>The graph can be used to show the history of a financial product (a.k.a security) like a stock but also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://club.makeimpact.io/posts/what-is-a-stock-market-index-%F0%9F%91%A8%F0%9F%92%BB-%F0%9F%97%82\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>a stock market index</u></a>, over a relatively long period. 👍 It has the advantage of giving a general idea of the security without having to pay too much attention to the details. 😆</p>\n\n<h4>The KPIs explained&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>On the right hand side of the graph, you will see a table like the one in the picture below. ⬇️ &nbsp;That shows the most relevant metrics or KPIs about the stock.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/33441123/1641904601159.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/33441123/1641904601159.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" style=\"height:329px; width:250px\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s take a look at what each of these means: 🔎</p>\n\n<ul>\n        <li>Previous close shows the prior day&#39;s final stock price when the market officially closes for the day. 🕓</li>\n        <li>The day range shows the highest and lowest price during that trading day. The difference between the two indicates the level of volatility that a particular security is experiencing, so how much the stock fluctuates within the day. 📈</li>\n        <li>The year range shows the highest and lowest price during one trading year. This is much more informative instead. The higher the range, the riskier the stock is. This is so because if you buy the stock and want to sell it at any point in time, and it is quite likely its stock price will fall in the future then you wait for the price to rise up again or do not wait and sell it at a loss. 📊</li>\n        <li>Market cap stands for market capitalization and refers to how much a company is worth as determined by the stock market. It is defined as the total market value of all outstanding shares. The company&#39;s market cap is calculated by multiplying the number of outstanding shares with the current market value of one share. 💰</li>\n        <li>Volume refers to the 30-days average number of shares traded each. 📆</li>\n        <li>P/E ratio can be very interesting! This stands for the price-to-earnings ratio, which some investors may use to decide if a stock is undervalued, overvalued, or fairly valued. Alone might be boring while being more informative when compared to the P/E of comparable corporations. If a company has a P/E above the market or sector average, it means that the market has high expectations about the value generation of the company in the coming months and years. A stock with a high P/E will have to meet the market&#39;s expectations by increasing its earnings, or else the price will have to fall. 📉</li>\n        <li>Dividend yield, expressed as a percentage, is a financial ratio (= $ amount of the dividend/ share price) that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price. It&#39;s important for investors to keep in mind that higher dividend yields do not always indicate attractive investment opportunities. Indeed, for example, the dividend yield of a stock may be elevated as the result of a declining stock price. 📊</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>The Financial Performance indicators of a stock&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/33441124/1641904601292.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/33441124/1641904601292.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" style=\"height:418px; width:500px\" /></a></p>\n\n<ul>\n        <li>Revenue is the total amount of income generated by the sale of goods or services related to the company&#39;s primary operations. So it is pretty much the money the company makes. 💶💶💶</li>\n        <li>Net income is calculated as revenues minus expenses, interest, and taxes. Investors should review the numbers used to calculate Net Income because expenses can be hidden in the accounting methods, or revenues can be inflated. Net income can either be partially or fully reinvested into the company&rsquo;s operations while whatever does not go there, it is distributed to shareholders through dividend payments 💰</li>\n        <li>Diluted earnings per share, also called diluted EPS, is a profitability calculation that measures the amount of income each share will receive if all of the dilutive securities are realized. 💸</li>\n        <li>Net profit margin measures how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenues received. It helps investors assess if a company&#39;s management is generating enough profit from its sales and whether operating costs and overhead costs are being contained. It is considered one of the most important indicators of a company&#39;s overall operational and performance health.❗️</li>\n        <li>Operating income reports the amount of profit realized from a business&#39;s ongoing operations. Analyzing operating income is helpful to investors because it doesn&#39;t include taxes and other one-off items that may skew a company&#39;s profit in a given year. 👏</li>\n        <li>Net cash figure is commonly used when evaluating a company&#39;s cash flows. Companies rely on cash to keep the wheels of their operations turning. 🚗💨 They use cash for payroll, asset purchases, and many other purposes. The net change in cash is the amount by which a company&rsquo;s cash balance increases or decreases in an accounting period. 📊 When you own or consider buying stock in a company, it is important to monitor its net change in cash to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t run out. You can use information from the three sections of a company&rsquo;s cash flow statement to calculate its net change in cash. 💰</li>\n        <li>Cash on hand refers to the amount of money that your business has immediately available on the last day of the reporting period. Companies with a healthy amount of cash and cash equivalents can reflect positively in their ability to meet their short-term debt obligations. 📆💰</li>\n        <li>Cost of revenue is the total cost of manufacturing and delivering a product or service to consumers, including labor cost etc. In other words, it is the operational expenses. ⚙️⚙️⚙️</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/33441718/G43-2.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/33441718/G43-2.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This might be a lot of new information 😱 but you can come back here and refresh what you need whenever looking into a stock&rsquo;s financials. 🤓😎 And remember, invest with purpose.

Generally, hedge funds don&rsquo;t get good press. They are often associated with the speculative excess money of financiers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/33722822/G36_1.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/33722822/G36_1.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>So what is a Hedge Fund?</h4>\n\n<p>A hedge fund is an alternative&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-fund.asp\" target=\"_blank\"><u>investment fund</u></a>. Hedge funds are less regulated than traditional funds and they are often argued to be speculative. 😳 In other words, hedge funds seek to make a lot of profit and they use risky strategies to make the profit. So, Investors can expect high returns (and also high risk). 📈📉 Since, hedge funds are less regulated than traditional funds, they can use more aggressive investment strategies. Some of these strategies include derivatives, hedging, and leverage. The strategies will be explained later on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Investors engaging in hedge funds are mainly wealthier investors. Hedge funds are typically expensive to invest through since they have high fees. Furthermore, investors investing in hedge funds also need to be able to afford high risks. 💰💸&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Why are hedge funds called hedge funds?&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>The name hedge fund comes from hedging, a practice used by hedge funds. 🌳 Hedging means investing in opposite positions. ⬅️➡️ This practice can be very sophisticated. It is important to understand that its purpose is to reduce risk, like a form of insurance. As an example, to make it more simple, it can consist of investing in a company&rsquo;s stock while hedging the risk by taking&nbsp;<a href=\"https://club.makeimpact.io/posts/shorting-stocks-what-actually-happened-with-gamestop-%F0%9F%91%BE%F0%9F%8E%AE\" target=\"_blank\"><u>short positions</u></a>&nbsp;on the very same stock. This way the hedge fund bets in one direction while still limiting potential losses if the market should move in the opposite direction. It should be noted that hedging is never perfect and there is always a considerable amount of exposure to risk. ⚡️</p>\n\n<p>Hedging is a form of derivative. Derivatives are a way to speculate in the future value of an underlying asset. They are a complex trading practice and are reserved for experienced traders. 🤓📚 Derivatives are viewed as having asymmetric risk where the maximum loss is much smaller than the potential gain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/33722791/G36.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/33722791/G36.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>To earn more, hedge funds use leverage&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>The technique of leverage means that hedge funds buy assets using debt more or less combined with their own capital (the higher the debt used as a percentage of the paying price for the asset, the higher the leverage). Indeed, the use of leverage can magnify returns. With an example, it is easier to understand. 💡 Imagine a company that needs a new machine to produce. The machine costs 1000&euro; and makes it possible to gain a yearly 10% of its initial value in revenues. So, the company earns 100&euro; per year. 💸&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>If the company chooses to finance the entire paying price of the machine through its own capital (i.e. a company&#39;s own money or equity ). The profitability is 10% (=100&euro; /1000&euro;). 💶</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>If the company chooses to finance half of the price via debt, e.g. borrowing &nbsp;500&euro; at a 3% annual interest, the company must pay 15&euro; to the bank (= 500&euro; x 3%) while 85&euro; go to the company&#39;s shareholders. Therefore, the profitability is now 17% (=85&euro;/500&euro;). 💶 💶 💶</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The same applies to stocks. You can think of a stock as the production machine in the example. ⚙️</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/33722863/G36_3.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/33722863/G36_3.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Hedge funds use a lot of leverage (several times the size of the fund). If with leverage you can have much higher returns, you can also have much lower returns than without using leverage at all. Indeed, leverage multiplies the risk. The structure of these funds is complex and can be vulnerable (exposure to accounting failure) and impact many financial actors negatively. 😢</p>\n\n<p>Hedge funds are often put forth as being responsible for the financial crisis in 2008. 😕 If you have seen the movie &ldquo;The Big Short&rdquo;, you will know that global banks and fund managers had subprime (a financial word for &ldquo;risky&rdquo;) loans mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) which have been bundled together and sold as new financial products to different financial individuals and institutions. These financial products are also called CDOs (collateralized debt obligations). The subprime crisis caused the CDOs to collapse in value. 💥 CDOs became worthless and the hedge funds wanted to get rid of them but had a hard time selling those in the market. Having very high leverage, the funds suffered huge losses. 👎🏼</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/33722906/G36_4.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/33722906/G36_4.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>All in all, hedge funds can earn returns well above the market&rsquo;s when they bet right as well as incur huge losses when markets go down. Sometimes, they can bring down with them many other financial actors, like in 2008. That&#39;s not really what we mean by sustainable finance. ❌</p>\n\n<p>We hope this gives you a good understanding of what hedge funds are and how they operate. 😌 Remember, always strive to be the movement and makeimpact! ❤️</p>\n","a_creation":"18/01/2022","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

The NFDR addresses all large and listed companies (about 11,700), the CSRD extends sustainability regulation to non-listed large companies as well as listed Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) for a total number of about 49,000 companies across the EU. 🏢 The CSRD introduces more detailed reporting requirements. It is no longer enough to report policies and processes with respect to ESG, a strategy and specific targets have to be included in the business model and governance structure. Targets have to be measurable, tracked, and mandatorily disclosed. 🎯</p>\n\n<h4>Let&rsquo;s jump further into the CSRD! 😜</h4>\n\n<p>On top of extending the number of companies addressed, the CSRD entails:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Third-party audit (assurance) of reported information</strong>&nbsp;(i.e. external audit agency has to verify that the disclaimed information is correct and not manipulated). 💼</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Reporting has to be done according to&nbsp;<strong>mandatory EU sustainability reporting standards&nbsp;</strong>and with more detailed reporting requirements. 📄 SMEs will have fewer requirements than the larger corporations. 😇</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Requires companies to&nbsp;<strong>digitally &lsquo;tag&rsquo; the reported information</strong>, so it is machine-readable. 🖥&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Furthermore,&nbsp;<strong>a top management report about the company&#39;s ESGs</strong>&nbsp;has to be included. 🤗</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Overall, the CSRD has the scope to bring&nbsp;<em>sustainability reporting</em>&nbsp;to an equal footing of&nbsp;<em>financial reporting</em>. 🙌</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/34117676/G65_GIF_2.webp?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/34117676/G65_GIF_2.webp?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>When will the CSRD become effective? 📣</h4>\n\n<p>So far, the CSRD has been approved by the European Commission in the form of a proposal.

Polyester is a synthetic chemical fiber derived from petroleum. It can be argued that polyester is a material to avoid, as products derived from petroleum degrade with great difficulty in the environment. ❌ It is therefore necessary to avoid throwing them away, and try to extend their lifespan as much as possible by recycling the material. Note that recycled polyester as well as conventional polyester release microparticles that contaminate the water. But at least Nike is using more and more recycled polyester instead of the conventional one. ✅</p>\n\n<p><em>Social factors:</em></p>\n\n<p>The principal risk is labor conditions within the supply chain. 🙍🏼&zwj;♀️🙍🏽&zwj;♂️</p>\n\n<p>Like many other companies, Nike has production in Asia. In March 2020, an Australian Strategic Policy Institute&rsquo;s report &quot;Uyghurs for sale&quot; revealed that Uyghur slave laborers were working in factories supplying 83 well-known global brands with technology, apparel, footwear and automotive sectors, including Nike. Uyghurs are minority people with a Muslim majority living in the Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region of China and Central Asia and persecuted by the Chinese Regime. Several companies have announced to cut off all relations with subcontractors suspected of exploiting Uyghurs. ⚡️ Whether or not Nike has cut off all its relations as well is still uncertain.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/nike-says-china-based-supplier-stopped-hiring-employees-from-northwest-amid-forced-labour-allegations-but-critics-say-further-proof-is-needed/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>It is argued</u></a>&nbsp;that Nike still needs to provide the public with proof that it has stopped its relations to subcontractors exploiting Uyghurs. 😟</p>\n\n<p><em>Governance factors:</em></p>\n\n<p>Nike has put in its priority issues: Ethical and transparent corporate behavior. ⬆️</p>\n\n<p>That is, fighting against dishonest or fraudulent behavior of people in power, usually involving bribes, corruption and intellectual property infringement. ☝🏼</p>\n\n<h4>Financial information</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/34233760/1643276033837.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/34233760/1643276033837.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" style=\"height:351px; width:624px\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Nike&#39;s share price has risen by +117.8% in 4 years, well outpacing most of its competitors: +26.1% Adidas, +152.6% Puma, and 29.0% Under Armour. 👏🏼 While Adidas&rsquo; stock is still worth a lot more in absolute terms with a price of around $250, Nike has by far the larger market capitalization of about a quarter of a TRILLION dollars! 🤯</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/34233939/giphy3.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/34233939/giphy3.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Nike is also handling the Covid-19 crisis very well. After a drop in its EBIT in 2020, Nike came back even stronger in 2021 with record-high earnings and the highest EBIT margin in its recent history! 🤯 The extraordinary growth was strongly driven by Nike&rsquo;s digital sales. 👟 The European soccer tournament is also part of the equation, as Nike is the supplier of several national teams and therefore receives a good part of the profits on the jerseys sold. 💵 The 2021 performance translates into several other financial measures: Nike has a better ROA and ROE than its peers, meaning that it is better at providing value to its shareholders (ROE), effectively using their money, and using all its assets (ROA). ✅</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/34233759/1643276033679.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/34233759/1643276033679.png?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" style=\"height:351px; width:624px\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>For the upcoming year Nike&rsquo;s management is confident about the company&rsquo;s growth prospects, and it seems like the market and investors are as well when looking at Nike&rsquo;s valuation multiples. Nike has high ratios, generally higher than most of its competitors, which means that it is valued higher. 💎 The market believes that Nike will perform better than its peers. 📊 This might have something to do with Nike&rsquo;s recent performance, but of course this does not guarantee this will be the case for the future. What will certainly be very important is how Nike handles its ESG risks as sustainability issues are receiving more attention than ever! 🌳💚</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/34233977/giphy4.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/34233977/giphy4.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>To summarize, Nike engages in communities and focuses on getting more children into sports as well as making sports more inclusive for girls. However, when looking at labor and production, Nike has room for improvement. The financial performance of Nike is good. 😍 But remember to do your own analysis and research! 🙌 And most importantly be the movement - make!mpact! ❤️</p>\n","a_creation":"27/01/2022","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

It will give you a nice introduction to ETFs. 😍&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s have a more in-depth look at what an ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is and how you can see what&rsquo;s in your ETF. An ETF also called &ldquo;a tracker&rdquo; is an index fund. 🏦 This means an ETF follows an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://club.makeimpact.io/posts/what-is-a-stock-market-index-%F0%9F%91%A8%F0%9F%92%BB-%F0%9F%97%82\" target=\"_blank\"><u>index</u></a>, sector, commodity, bond, or another asset. 📊 While traditional funds seek to beat the benchmark, ETFs replicate the benchmark. 🤓&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>ETFs have many advantages: 🙌&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>1️⃣&nbsp;<em>Low expense ratios and fewer broker commissions</em><br />\nBuilding a stock portfolio is often expensive because for every stock you buy, you must pay fees. This is not the case with ETFs. So, if you want to invest only a small amount of money, ETFs may be a good choice for you! 🙌&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>2️⃣&nbsp;<em>Risk management through diversification</em><br />\nOne of the most important rules in investment is &ldquo;to not put all your eggs in the same basket&rdquo;. 🥚 An ETF allows you to diversify your investments. You don&rsquo;t invest in one company but several. Note that some ETFs are less diversified than others. ☝️&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>3️⃣&nbsp;<em>Passively managed&nbsp;</em><br />\nGenerally, when funds try to beat the market, they lose in the long run so if you want to invest for the long term, ETFs usually win.🏆 However, there are also actively managed ETFs with higher costs. It is important to differentiate between them. 👈&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>4️⃣&nbsp;<em>Access to many stocks across various industries</em><br />\nYou can choose ETFs that focus on targeted industries. 🎯 Or you can find ETFs that focus on ESG investing. 😻&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s impossible to know exactly what&rsquo;s in most ETFs without doing some research! 🔍</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/34293041/E40_1.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/34293041/E40_1.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>How to know what an ETF is investing in? 🤔</h4>\n\n<p>Each ETF follows a specific index. For example, in the American market, there are 3 big indexes:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-the-nasdaq-composite/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Nasdaq</u></a><br />\nThis is an index with a high concentration of technology firms listed in the Nasdaq stock exchange. It is therefore not very diversified. 💻 📱</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/050115/what-does-dow-jones-industrial-average-measure.asp\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Dow Jones</u></a><br />\nThis index is even more limited as it includes only 30 companies. 🏢</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp\" target=\"_blank\"><u>S&amp;P 500</u></a><br />\nThe S&amp;P 500 index includes the 500 biggest companies listed in the United States. This index is therefore to a certain degree well diversified. However, it is worth noting that 30% of its companies are in the technology sector. 💻<br />\n<br />\nThere are also World ETFs. 🌎🌍🌏 Contrary to what the name may indicate, they don&rsquo;t allow you to invest in the whole world. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.msci.com/our-solutions/indexes/developed-markets\" target=\"_blank\"><u>MSCI World</u></a>&nbsp;only includes countries considered as &ldquo;developed&rdquo; (e.g. Europe, United States, Japan, Australia, and Canada).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If you would like an index with more countries included there&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.msci.com/our-solutions/indexes/acwi\" target=\"_blank\"><u>MSCI ACWI (All Country World Index</u>)</a>, which is a broader index that also includes emerging economies. 📊</p>\n\n<h4>The first step when choosing an ETF 💃</h4>\n\n<p>When you choose an ETF, you may want to decide what exposure you&rsquo;re looking for. 🤓 When choosing what exposure you are looking for, you can use these criteria and ask yourself the following questions: 👇</p>\n\n<p>1️⃣&nbsp;<em>Asset classes</em><br />\nDo you want exposure to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://club.makeimpact.io/posts/what-is-a-stock-and-a-bond-%F0%9F%93%88-14763148\" target=\"_blank\"><u>stocks</u></a>&nbsp;via equity ETFs or exposure to fixed-income investments through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://club.makeimpact.io/posts/what-is-a-stock-and-a-bond-%F0%9F%93%88-14763148\" target=\"_blank\"><u>bond</u></a>&nbsp;ETFs?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>2️⃣&nbsp;<em>Geographical area</em><br />\nDo you prefer only European countries? Or maybe you would like to invest in emerging economies?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>3️⃣&nbsp;<em>Company size</em><br />\nDo you prefer established companies or fast-growing smaller companies?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>4️⃣&nbsp;<em>Sector</em><br />\nDo you prefer a few specific industries or a wide range of industries?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>When answering these questions, remember to take into account what exposure you already have in your portfolio. It is a good idea to choose ETFs that complement your initial investments. 😊 If you already have a well-diversified investment portfolio, you could choose to complement it with an ETF focusing on specific industries. 💁 If you are a beginner, then maybe you want to start by choosing a more diversified ETF. 💁&zwj;♂️ It is also important to know what you want to limit your exposure to. For example if you own several properties, it may be a good idea to limit your exposure to real estate in your ETF. 🙃</p>\n\n<h4>The second step could be to check the dividend distribution policy 😜</h4>\n\n<p>When choosing an ETF, you can also ask yourself whether you would like to generate money that you can withdraw and spend? Or you would like your investment to maximize in the future? 🤷&zwj;♀️&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If you invest in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.justetf.com/uk/news/etf/distributing-or-accumulating-etfs-how-to-handle-investment-income.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>distributing ETF</u></a>, you will receive dividends or coupons as if you had invested directly in a stock (or a bond). This is good if you need complementary revenue. 💵 If you invest in an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.justetf.com/uk/news/etf/distributing-or-accumulating-etfs-how-to-handle-investment-income.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>accumulating ETF</u></a>, the coupons or dividends will be reinvested automatically in your ETF. It&rsquo;s good if you want to make your investments grow. 💰 To put it simply,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://club.makeimpact.io/posts/what-is-interest-%F0%9F%A4%94\" target=\"_blank\"><u>reinvested dividends</u></a>&nbsp;will make babies. 👶</p>\n\n<p>So, it&#39;s a good idea to check out the factsheet before investing! ✌️</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/34293304/E40_2.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format\"><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/34293304/E40_2.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>Outlook on ESG and ETFs 💫</h4>\n\n<p>There are several types of ETFs that may be suitable when you have a sustainable investment approach. 🌈 But the selection of ESG criteria varies quite a lot, and it is therefore good to know how to differentiate the different approaches used by ETFs. 🤓</p>\n\n<p><strong>👉 Exclusion fund&nbsp;</strong><br />\nExclusion funds are not always very challenging in their ESG approach. 🤔 The main difference between exclusion funds and traditional funds is that these funds exclude controversial sectors such as fossil fuel, alcohol, tobacco, or firearms companies. 🚭</p>\n\n<p><strong>👉 Thematic fund&nbsp;</strong><br />\nThese funds are often not very diversified since they target a specific theme, such as access to water, ecological transition, employment and solidarity, emerging economies, health etc. 🌱 So, these funds are concentrated in one industry or sector. Depending on your other investments and your risk profile, it is worth noting the narrow focus on industries and sectors, and figure out if this fits your investment profile. 👩&zwj;💻👨&zwj;💻</p>\n\n<p>To sum up, ETFs are an excellent tool to invest and diversify your portfolio! 💪 Nonetheless, it is important to check what kind of ETF you are investing in and how it fits your investment profile.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Remember - &nbsp;be the movement and makeimpact! ❤️</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","a_creation":"08/02/2022","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

Today, about half of the world&rsquo;s population is living in cities, and this number is projected to grow from 3.5 to 5 billion by 2050. 😳 Cities are seen as the powerhouses of economic growth, but they also account for most of the world&rsquo;s emissions and energy consumption. ⚡️ Not only that, but the rapid urbanization puts pressure on the environment, public health and local water supply. 💦 🌱 Naturally, this raises concerns about how cities can become more inclusive and sustainable. That is why we decided to take a look at what some of the most important cities in the world do to ensure a sustainable future! 👏🏼&nbsp;</p>  <p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/37918242/E85_gif_1.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>  <p>First: New York City - the city that never sleeps. 🇺🇸 A huge city like New York can work with most of the SDGs in a local context. 🌃 A key part of New York&rsquo;s strategy is the belief that local and regional governments play a key role in reaching the SDG targets. 🤝 Following the global adoption of the UN SDGs in 2015, New York set up the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/international/programs/global-vision-urban-action.page\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Global Vision | Urban Action</u></a>&nbsp;platform, which was aligned with New York&rsquo;s development plan called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onenyc.cityofnewyork.us/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>OneNYC</u></a>. The platform allows local governments to share information and create innovative solutions to challenges using the lens of the SDGs, amongst other things. 🔍 Another milestone is that in 2018, New York became the first city to report its sustainability progress directly to the United Nations - and it has inspired others to do so, too! 🎉 Pretty amazing, right? 🤩 It definitely seems like New York is committed to sustainability. 😍 We&rsquo;ll see what the future holds! 🌱</p>  <p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/37918256/E85_gif_2.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>  <p>If we&rsquo;re talking about large cities, then the megacity of Tokyo in Japan should not be missing from the list. 🇯🇵 With a population of around 14 million citizens, Tokyo sees its responsibility to be a global leader in sustainability. 🌎 So far, the city has taken steps towards becoming a &ldquo;smart energy city&rdquo;, driving forward a low-carbon transportation system, and making its water infrastructure sustainable. 💦 Smart cities are a concept aiming to make cities more efficient, greener, and socially inclusive through the use of data and technology. 👩&zwj;💻🧑&zwj;💻 In March 2021, a new long-term sustainability strategy was introduced which is in line with the SDGs. One key aspect of the strategy is &ldquo;to leave no one behind&rdquo; which reflects SDG 8: To promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. ✨</p>  <p>Important news is also that Tokyo joined New York in reporting its progress to achieve the SDGs to the UN in 2021. 📄 That&rsquo;s news we enjoy hearing! 😍</p>  <p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/37918273/E85_gif_3.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>  <p>Next up: London. 🇬🇧 While London so far has not committed to voluntarily disclosing its sustainability progress to the UN, it was indeed crowned as the most sustainable city in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.arcadis.com/campaigns/citizencentriccities/images/%7B1d5ae7e2-a348-4b6e-b1d7-6d94fa7d7567%7Dsustainable_cities_index_2018_arcadis.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>2018 Arcadis Sustainable Cities Index</u></a>, which measures city sustainability from the perspective of the citizen. 🥳 London scored high in the economic and social pillars, but, you guessed it&hellip; it scored lower on environmental pillars due to air quality and waste management issues. ☹️ London has had a Sustainable Development Commission (LSDC) since 2002, and this commission now also uses the SDGs to measure London&rsquo;s sustainability progress. The LSDC has celebrated many great achievements, but it also acknowledges that London has a lot of work to do, particularly when it comes to inequality. ⚡️ The fact that housing is extremely expensive surely plays a role in why more than a quarter of Londoners live in relative poverty. 💷 💔 Reducing these inequalities was identified as an important step that could also lead to improvements in other social areas such as public health and homelessness. As the saying goes: self-reflection is the first step to improvement. ☝🏼</p>  <p><img src=\"https://media1-production-mightynetworks.imgix.net/asset/37918299/E85_gif_4.gif?ixlib=rails-0.3.0&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1400&amp;h=1400&amp;fit=max&amp;impolicy=ResizeCrop&amp;constraint=downsize&amp;aspect=fit\" /></p>  <p>Paris, je t&rsquo;aime! 🇫🇷 But do we also love Paris&rsquo; progress in sustainable development? Let&rsquo;s see! Since 2007, Paris has had Climate Action Plans, thanks to which the city&rsquo;s carbon footprint has decreased by about 20% in the last 15 years. 🌱 By 2050 Paris plans to be carbon neutral - we fully support that ambition! Furthermore, Paris wants to become the greenest city in Europe. 🌿 To achieve this, there are initiatives to make urban spaces more eco-friendly, limit congestion, and create more green spaces. 💚 When it comes to the social dimension of sustainability, Paris views its Climate Action Plan also as a means for sustainable economic and social development. 🙌&nbsp;</p>  <p>On a side note: The Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2024 which are going to be hosted in Paris are planned to be the first (of hopefully many) climate-positive. Yay! 😍&nbsp;</p>  <p>Cities are looking for innovative solutions to improve their sustainable development</p>  <p>What all these cities have in common is that they are trying to become greener and grow more inclusively. But how can this be achieved? 🤔 Well, there are a lot of new innovative solutions to improve urban living. Some of them such as vertical farming you might already know from reading our article about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://club.makeimpact.io/posts/the-future-of-food-%F0%9F%90%9F\" target=\"_blank\">the&nbsp;<u>future of food</u></a><u>.</u>&nbsp;🍱 Several cities are also planning to adopt&nbsp;<a href=\"https://club.makeimpact.io/posts/what-is-the-circular-economy-%F0%9F%A4%94%F0%9F%94%81\" target=\"_blank\"><u>circular economy</u></a>&nbsp;approaches based on the principles of sharing, reusing, and restoration. ♻️ And very importantly, they are trying to become smarter and optimize existing resources through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and other modern technology. 💻 Of course, all these solutions need financing. But just to give you an example, the AI market is expected to grow by more than 40% until 2028, and there are billions of dollars invested in it. 💵 Maybe you&rsquo;re interested in investing in AI companies as well? 💸&nbsp;</p>  <p>Overall, we&rsquo;re seeing that sustainable development is definitely on the agenda in today&rsquo;s most important cities. 🌎 As it should be. 😌 We hope sustainability is on your agenda, too.

The financial institutions are making efforts at a varied level to make their financing and investment decisions sustainable. What are these players doing in order to make sustainable investing truly meaningful? Why was Sustainable Finance Disclosure regulation introduced in the EU and how can it make the journey easier for the impact investors? What is the Principal Adverse Impact in SFDR? 🤷</p>  <p>Let&rsquo;s unravel the mystery behind them!! 🙌</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>👉 </strong><strong>Principal Adverse Impact (PAI)</strong></p>  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>PAIs are disclosure statements within the ambit of <strong>Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation. </strong>SFDR was introduced in the EU in March 2021 to regulate sustainable investing, by requiring financial market participants (like banks, mutual funds, pension funds) to transparently report the negative impact of their financing and advisory decisions on the sustainable factors. ☝️ A principal adverse impact is the result of investment decisions (and advice) that cause negative effects on sustainability factors. By measuring adverse impacts associated with the activities of underlying investee companies, PAI analyzes how sustainability factors are impacted. 💁&zwj;♂️</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>👉 </strong><strong>What are the negative impacts?&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>Article 4 of the SFDR requires financial market participants (including managers) to publish and maintain information regarding the adverse impacts their investment decision-making process may have on sustainability factors on their websites. So, this obligation to &lsquo;comply or explain&rsquo; is at entity level and not on individual funds. Thus, managers will need to aggregate information at funds level to present them at the entity level.</p>  <p>Furthermore, according to Article 7 of the SFDR, the prospectus of each fund must indicate whether the manager fulfills the reporting requirements imposed by Article 4 and whether it considers the principal adverse impacts of investment decisions on sustainability factors when managing its assets.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>👉 </strong><strong>What type of PAI indicators should managers&rsquo; report?</strong></p>  <p>The PAI indicators are categorized into mandatory (18 in total) and optional (46 in total). Their focus will be on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors commonly observed by investors. The disclosure regarding them is at both product and entity level. At the product level entities must disclose how PAIs are integrated into all aspects of a product and at the entity level measurement and disclosure of PAI must be done for the entity.</p>  <p>PAIs could be either climate and environmental 🌱 related indicators or social and employee 👩&zwj;💼👨&zwj;💼 matters.

Let&rsquo;s understand what emissions and emissions intensity are, and the importance of measuring them. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">☝️</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What are carbon emissions? </strong><strong>🤔</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carbon emissions, or the GHG emissions, are the Greenhouse Gasses emitted by various human activities. These gasses like CO2, Methane, Chlorofluorocarbons etc. cause global warming and climate change. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🥵 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internationally GHG protocol does the accounting and reporting of emissions, and these emissions are categorized into three segments:&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👉 </span><strong>Scope 1:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> These are the direct emissions from the assets owned and/or controlled by the company. For example, machines and equipment </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🏗 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">owned by the company or buses </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🚌 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">operated by the company for employee transportation.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👉</span> <strong>Scope 2:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Indirect emissions from purchased electricity, the cooling or heating system. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">💡</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👉 </span><strong>Scope 3:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This segment&nbsp; also consists of indirect emissions and is the most comprehensive one. It&nbsp; includes all the emissions in the value chain. For example, emissions by vehicles used by employees for commuting to work. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🚙 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This emission is more complex than the other two as the investee company will have limited control over the data and reporting of it.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>GHG intensity and its measurement </strong><strong>📈</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GHG intensity is defined&nbsp; as the volume of carbon emissions per million dollars of revenue (carbon efficiency of a portfolio, expressed in tons CO2e/ $M revenue). Simply saying, it is the total emissions divided by total units of production or total economic activity.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Total GHG intensity of electricity generation is calculated as the ratio of CO2 equivalent emissions from all sources of electricity production (including nuclear power plants, wind farms, and solar farms) to total electricity production. A total of energy consumption in production overhead and additional emission in the production process to calculate&nbsp; total GHGs released in energy consumption.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GHG Intensity means the total greenhouse gas emissions of the parent company and its subsidiaries measured in Metric Tons of CO2e, per Million Dollars in revenue. The metric tons of CO2e includes Scope 1 (direct) and Sope 2 (energy indirect, market-based) emissions according to the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocols.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Why is this indicator important? </strong><strong>🧐</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carbon dioxide or CO2 has a major role in the total GHG emission, i.e., almost 75%. The other GHGs are methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons etc. Though naturally present in the air, Greenhouse Gasses make the earth surface warmer causing multiple ripple effects on climate, biodiversity and our health. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">😣</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Due to human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and production of electricity, this effect has increased substantially causing climate change and global warming.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>How could the GHG intensity be reduced? </strong><strong>📉</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improved energy efficiency, conservation, and the use of lower-carbon energy sources are the most cost-effective ways to decrease GHG intensity. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">☝️ </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International climate policy is regulated by the United Nations, and through a series of climate summits, also known as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate change, measures were taken to reduce corporate emission intensity. The main accounting tool used till now is the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, used as a standard for quantifying and reporting organizational level carbon footprint. The United Nations Environmental Program Agency collects and reports data from major industrial sources of GHG emissions.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, legislation came into force in the EU in March 2021, under the name Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation short SFDR. This regulation is a comprehensive piece of law for making the financial system sustainable as it requires institutional investors and financial advisors to report on sustainability risk and principal adverse impact (PAI). </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👏 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These PAIs are the impact of social or climate factors. You can read more about these PAIs in our earlier articles in the series. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👈&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Okay, but how would SFDR help with GHGs? </strong><strong>🤨</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SFDR has made it mandatory for financial market participants to disclose the GHG intensity in the PAI template. So, now with a detailed explanation of emissions (scope-wise) as well as emission intensity, it would be easier to make an assessment of companies in terms of whether they are actually doing the emissions or just a part of their value chain.</span><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, with the new SFDR, we, the investors interested in green investment funds, will know much more about whether these funds are </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">actually</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> green and sustainable, and also how their financials might be influenced by sustainability risks. 🤤 GHG emissions are a good way to measure climate-related and reputational risk in your investment.</span></p> <p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/nbvFVPiEiJH6JOGIok/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47vonyykgbjj3g553t2f2ogltrktcsth6uz1xoz6kw&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g\"></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Who does this apply to?</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being an EU</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">directive, the SFDR directly applies to the financial market participants and advisors inside the European Union.

Moreover, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, oil and nuclear energy cannot replenish themselves, hence their consumption and production are limited in supply. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🙅&zwj;♂️ </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, we are still dependent on these energy sources in our daily lives. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">😕 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you thought about how much percentage of non-renewable energy is in the consumption and production of your investee companies</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? Because the higher the percentage of renewable sources in their energy mix, the more sustainable these companies are! </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">💚</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>👉 </strong><strong>What does SFDR say about renewable sources?</strong></p> <p><strong>Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> talks about consumption and production of non-renewable sources of energy as one of the disclosure requirements from the investee company. This Act aims at bringing transparency and standardization in the field of sustainable investing. The Act has 18 Principal Adverse Impacts (disclosure statements) relating to companies, supranational or real estate sectors on environmental &amp; social matters.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The metric uses the share of non-renewable energy consumption and non-renewable energy production of investee companies from non-renewable energy sources compared to renewable energy sources expressed as a percentage. Reducing this percentage is crucial to meet the Paris Agreement goals of a carbon neutral planet by 2050. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">☝️</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong>Why is renewable energy good for the planet? </strong><strong>🌎</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Renewable energy sources are clean and sustainable sources of energy, e.g., solar, wind, hydropower, and solid biofuels. Moreover, they have the potential to replace fossil fuel in three main sectors such as cooling &amp; heating, electricity, and transportation. They are both economical and sustainable in the long run. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👍 For instance, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the economic cost of solar energy is foreseeable and could be planned. On the other hand, the cost of natural gas is not only affected by economic factors but also geo-political factors (as seen in war situations). </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">😔 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, alternative energy is sustainable from a financial and non-financial (Environmental, Social, Governance) view point. SFDR aims at minimizing greenwashing and offering a transparent view into sustainability investments for the end users. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">😌</span></p> <p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/czubJ08i7deuKGJE9A/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47iy14gg7c91ri0wqkw7bglaak8hjftamhx4jecgk3&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g\"></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong>That&rsquo;s great!

A company must work on not only the financial aspect or financial materiality but also the impact materiality (the E, S and G aspects). The Act covers the financial materiality in terms of sustainability risks, which are the sustainability issues (climate change, gender disparity) that can have a negative impact on the economic returns of an investment. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">📉 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sustainability risks refer to the risks that sustainability factors have on a fund&rsquo;s financial return. Principal Adverse Impacts, on the other hand, cover the impact materiality. They are the negative impacts that the fund has on &ldquo;environmental, social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti‐corruption and anti‐bribery matters.&rdquo; 👀</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, with the new legislative tool in the form of SFDR, end users can be sure of getting reliable ESG information for investing their capital toward Sustainable Development Goals. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👏</span></p> <p><strong>Who does this apply to?</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A European Union directive, the SFDR applies directly to participants of the financial markets and advisors within the EU. It does, however, not exclude institutions located outside of the Union from its impact. 😱 Anyone marketing their product within the EU must follow the rules laid out by the directive, whether they are European or not. 😮 We can also expect to see many overseas companies disclose their sustainability risks and impacts as the EU is the third-largest economy in the world (behind the US and China).</span></p> <p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/stnceXs4IQLFZNYXg2/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e479qhjmrxvl65if5ncs5mr2ep4h3g0g152x1vibzeu&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g\"></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong>This sounds amazing!

What steps is the government taking to recycle and reduce this waste? And what do we call a hazardous waste?</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s find out together! 💪</span></p> <p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/BpGWitbFZflfSUYuZ9/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47c9afxceifbg5bg8gq3shm4epbr7jndqsldfztwre&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g\"></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Waste is any substance or object which the holder discards, intends or is required to discard. It potentially represents an enormous loss of resources in the form of both materials and energy. In simple words, waste is anything which we dispose of after use. 🚮 In addition, the management and disposal of waste can have serious environmental impacts. 😰 For example, landfill takes up land space and may cause soil, air and water pollution, while </span><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Incineration\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">incineration</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may result in emissions of air pollutants.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Examples of waste could be anything from clothes👚 to daily waste 🗑️, to electronic items 📱. Waste is treated differently according to their types in order to reduce their impact on the environment. In the short term, efforts are made to recycle it but in the long term, the focus should be on reducing it, also known as the concept of circular economy. ♻️</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong>👉What is hazardous waste?</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hazardous waste is more dangerous to human health and environment if it is not separated and disposed of properly. It could be in gaseous, liquid or solid state. They could have in general one or more of the traits or characteristics: reactivity, toxicity, corrosivity or ignitability. Few examples are: batteries, petrol and kerosene, paints, pesticides and garden based chemicals. In the EU, in 2018, around 4.4% of the waste generated was hazardous. In general, waste is disposed of through landfill, deposited into land or released into water bodies, which as you can imagine, is not great. 😪</span></p> <p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohhwH6yMO7ED5xc7S/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47erau8zdwf8tmgrpn7evyzl1r63j1ur2flcqh4vnx&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g\"></p> <p><strong>Okay, so how do we deal with this hazardous waste? 🤨</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) is working towards reducing harmful and hazardous waste by providing support through scientific assessment and raising awareness about the issue. The Basel convention signed in 1992 is one of the major global efforts to control transboundary movement of hazardous waste and their disposal. Hence, basically the </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">polluter pays</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> principle applies here too. 💰 Recently, a new legislation has been introduced in the EU in March 2021, with the name Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, in short SFDR. This regulation is a comprehensive piece of law for making the financial system sustainable. This has included hazardous waste ratio as a PAI or Principal Adverse Impact. These PAIs are impacts of financing decisions on sustainable factors.</span></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>What is this PAI, is this related to pie??</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, it gets kind of technical here, but we&rsquo;ve got you! We&rsquo;ll list them for easier understanding:</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>So, what is the logic behind these PAI indicators? 🤷</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite years of efforts, hazardous waste remains a concern, and the amount is increasing substantially over the years. 📈 The PAI indicator of hazardous waste ratio in SFDR is another attempt to eliminate this gap by stopping the fundings to companies who do not follow the guidelines to handle hazardous waste disparity in one or the other form. These PAI indicators will impact the stock selection in a big way and the fund manager will try to create portfolios with good PAI indicators.

This will create equal chances for both men and women to use their talent and increase economic growth as well as competitiveness in society.🤩</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/2lozkZo93pKfm48xfl/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47e559w2iqvzfdqzzfsw0yszw6ocf9qoehkkgxgpa3&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g\"></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>👉So..

The PAI indicator of board gender diversity in SFDR is another attempt to eliminate this disparity by stopping the funding to companies that still do not make an effort to employ female directors at the top level.🙌 These companies cannot keep doing tokenism in the name of gender equality while not increasing the percentage of women directors or the companies need to explain why female CEOs are at such a minimum level.☝️</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;So, as an investor, you should be happy about these indicators, as the investee companies need to disclose this on an annual level if they need money from the market to grow.🚀</span></p> <p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/IHnROpQICe4kE/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47tfiexgdnxmyqw6vqixoa44wism32hdhw5fcdfs8x&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g&nbsp\"></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Lmao ok, nerds.

There are many international agreements among countries to use these weapons safely. The production and use of these weapons are banned by treaties. However, countries still use these weapons whenever a situation of national interest arises. So, it becomes necessary to regulate the companies who are manufacturing and providing these weapons. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">☝️ </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a responsible investor, the exposure of investee companies in these controversial weapons that include nuclear weapons, is a necessary indicator of your contribution to creating a peaceful society. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">☮️</span></p> <p><br /><br /><br /></p> <p><strong>👉 </strong><strong>What measures are being taken at (inter)national level?</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A number of international conventions exist to control production, distribution, use and transfer of these arms, for example, Geneva protocol, Treaty on the Non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, Biological Weapon Convention, and Oslo convention.&nbsp; These treaties have their applicability at the global level. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🌎 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However we need to focus on controlling the money which is going to finance production of these weapons.

Let&rsquo;s understand the concept of GHG intensity for the investee countries. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">💪</span></p> <p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/lVmoD0bue8ftd7E7Q2/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47pmd0zrws2frcoe3j2p5lhrie3f21j76p3d64w87v&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g\"></p> <p><strong>What are GHG emissions? </strong><strong>🤔</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GHG emissions or carbon emissions are gasses such as Carbon dioxide or CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons which have profound impact on the earth&rsquo;s temperature, leading to climate change. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🥵 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GHG protocol does the accounting and reporting of emissions, and these emissions are categorized into three segments:</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👉 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scope 1: These are the direct emissions from the assets owned and/or controlled by the company. For example, machines or equipment </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🏗 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">owned by the company, buses </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🚌</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> operated by the company for employee transportation.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👉 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scope 2: Indirect emissions from purchased electricity, from the cooling or heating system.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">💡</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👉 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scope 3: This segment is also indirect emission and the most comprehensive one.&nbsp; This includes all the emissions in the value chain. For example, emissions by vehicles </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🚙 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">used by employees for commuting to work. This emission is more complex than the other two as the investee company will have limited control over the data and reporting of it.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>GHG intensity and its measurement </strong><strong>📈</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GHG intensity is the emission rate of greenhouse gasses or the ratio of a particular pollutant to a specific activity or manufacturing process; for instance, the grams of carbon dioxide released per megajoule of energy produced, or the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions to gross domestic produc</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t (GD</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">P). Technically, GHG intensity is defined&nbsp; as the volume of carbon emissions per million dollars of revenue (carbon efficiency of a portfolio, expressed in tons CO2e/ $M revenue). While measuring GHG intensity for an investee country, it is the total emissions divided by total units of production or total economic activity.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>So, can we measure it&hellip;? How? </strong><strong>😮</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It seems we can!! </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🙌 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, GHG intensity of total electricity generation is taken as the ratio of CO2 equivalent emissions from all electricity production (both from main activity producers and auto-producers) to total electricity generation, including electricity from nuclear plants and renewable sources. Similarly, for arriving at the total GHGs released in energy consumption for production, an aggregate of GHGs released in energy consumption for overhead, GHGs released by transport used for business travel and additional GHGs released from the production process is taken into account.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/glmRyiSI3v5E4/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47eukpexvqb7h9hsezg5dh65yfrdzl8mr2b1qqqktn&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g\"></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take for instance, if the investee company makes a car, then GHG released from the factory, in the supply chain and also by the employees personal transportation to the company is considered to calculate the GHG intensity.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we measure the emission intensity, we include both Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (energy indirect, market-based) emissions in the the metric tons of CO2e (according to the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocols).</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Why is this indicator important? </strong><strong>☝️</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because this indicator is the best indicator of the carbon footprint </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👣 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and emission level of a country</span><strong>.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Countries, such as Sweden, France, Luxemburg with higher usage of renewable power in their energy mix are having lower GHG intensity. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">📉 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whereas, countries such as Poland, Cyprus, Estonia and Greece had the highest electricity generation carbon intensity in the EU in 2020. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">📈</span></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>How could the GHG intensity be reduced? </strong><strong>👇</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improved energy efficiency, conservation, and the use of lower-carbon energy sources are the most cost-effective ways to decrease GHG intensity. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🙌 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International climate policy is regulated by the United Nations and through a series of climate summits, also known as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate change, measures were taken to reduce corporate emission intensity. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">✊ </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main accounting tool used till now is the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, used as a standard for quantifying and reporting organizational level carbon footprint. The United Nations Environmental Program Agency collects and reports data from major industrial sources of GHG emissions.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, legislation came into force in the EU in March 2021, under the name Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation short SFDR. This regulation is a comprehensive piece of law for making the financial system sustainable as it requires institutional investors and financial advisors to report on sustainability risk and principal adverse impact (PAI). These PAIs are the impact of social or climate factors.

These social factors have a material impact on the investment opportunity because different rating agencies rank a country not just on economic criteria but social metrics too. For example, recently Fitch downgraded the sovereign rating of Russia from &lsquo;B&rsquo; to &lsquo;C&rsquo;, which simply means the country has a higher default risk. And the reason given by the rating agency is that Russia has an ESG Relevance Score (RS) of '5'(poor) for both Political Stability and Rights and for the Rule of Law, Institutional and Regulatory Quality and Control of Corruption. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👎</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is also in line with the World Bank Governance Indicators measuring dimensions of governance. Hence, despite having a good Balance Sheet assessment, a country can still have a low rating (due to social and governance factors).</span></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>So, how to measure social violations by investee countries? </strong><strong>🤔</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The social violations could be measured by the number of investee countries subject to social violations (absolute number and relative number divided by all investee countries) as referred to in international treaties and convention, United Nations, principles, and where applicable national law</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, how would you rank a country in your investment options, if the country performs poorly in transparency index (to measure corruption) or Gini-coefficient (to measure economic inequality) or human development index? Sooner or later, the poor performance in the social parameters will be reflected in the investment scenario too! </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">😱</span></p> <p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/1qgIVb1F6Bfj2Gz6pQ/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47y95azi1s9tfdigu7bzi5uf070zb435big2aozchg&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g\"></p> <p><strong>But why is it in the news in the ESG investing space now?</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) talks about the social violations by the investee countries as one of the PAI statements. In the absence of any mandatory reporting for the financial market participants for their investment in sovereign countries, it was quite challenging to find sustainable options. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">😰</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier, principles were laid down by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization&rsquo;s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, and the UN Convention Against Corruption for the countries. However, these guidelines didn&rsquo;t have any legal mandate plus a lack of clarity in defining social violations by countries. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">😒</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, after SFDR, double materiality should be a focus for you as an investor. Both financial materiality and impact materiality should be taken into account by the institutional investor. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">☝️</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong>Who does SFDR apply to?</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being an EU</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">directive, the SFDR directly applies to the financial market participants and advisors inside the European Union. This, however, does not mean that it has no impact on institutions based outside of the union. 😱 Any investment manager, European or not, who wishes to market their product to potential clients within the EU must follow the rules set out by the directive. 😮</span><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/portlet_file_entry/2995521/2-19052020-BP-EN.pdf/bb14f7f9-fc26-8aa1-60d4-7c2b509dda8e\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EU comprising the third-largest economy in the world</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (behind the US and China), it is an attractive market &ndash; therefore, it is very plausible that we&rsquo;ll also see many overseas companies disclose their sustainability risks and impacts in the near future.</span></p> <h1 style=\"color: #5e9ca0;\">&nbsp;</h1> <p><strong>Great!! Tell me more! </strong><strong>😎</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the pandemic, a significant number of institutional investors are looking at the poor performance of the countries in social factors. According to the EY Global Institutional Investor Survey, &lsquo;74% of institutional investors now are more likely to &ldquo;divest&rdquo; based on poor environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance, than before the COVID-19 pandemic&rsquo;.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to risk specific to companies, there are country risks involved in investing in a supranational company. Moody&rsquo;s, Standard &amp; Poor and other large rating agencies give ratings to this country, however most of these ratings consider the country&rsquo;s economic and financial fundamentals. Hence, the sovereign ratings may not give a complete picture while investing in a country.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diversity, equity and inclusion initiates are the crucial parameters to check sustainability level of an investee country. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🙌</span></p> <p><strong>👉 </strong><strong>Why does monitoring investments in investee countries matter?</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because they are the source of long-term finance for the investee countries' development. And also, ESG factors are material to investment decision making not just for the impact investors, but for the quality of life of the people from the concerned country.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, with the new SFDR and social violations by the investee country as one of the PAI indicators, we, the investors interested in ethical and sustainable society, will know much more about whether these funds are actually working towards this goal and where do they stand in comparison to their competitors.</span></p> <h1 style=\"color: #5e9ca0;\">&nbsp;</h1> <p><strong>I guess that&rsquo;s all kind of nice&hellip; But why should </strong><strong><em>I</em></strong><strong> care? </strong><strong>🤷&zwj;♂️</strong></p> <p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/2xwWl4iiaR0UKIiiRQ/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e472j69jb2adsyt7l23zb71wq6m39dubeopgdxvmu5i&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g\"></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because transparency is the new human right, disclosure about the adverse social violations is key to curb greenwashing. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👏 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The institutional efforts must intensify their efforts to make an impact in the society in terms of quality of life.</span></p> <h1 style=\"color: #5e9ca0;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These PAI indicators along with others are working towards the UN SDG goals through controlling finance to the investee companies.&nbsp; Hence, the sustainable funds under SFDR would be easier to identify based on their PAI statements and their ranking based on the metrics used.

Surprisingly, the gender pay gap exists even in the so-called developed countries.😮 According to data from the International Labor Organisation (an International body regulating labor laws throughout the world), this difference is e.g., as high as 45% in the African country of Sierra Leone or almost negligible in Panama.😢 Even in Europe, a persisting gap of 14.1% has been seen despite decades of efforts from the government's side.🤯</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong>Why is it important to bridge this gender pay gap? 🤔</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has been proven by various reports and indices that gender equality in all forms is essential for the development of a nation.📈 If females don&rsquo;t get&nbsp; equal pay for their work as men, it will be reflected in their social status and lead to their social exclusion.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🙅</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That is why closing this gap would positively impact the world GDP (Gross Domestic Product).</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🤞🏻</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/70YaDoZ1VqBZ8SgYiz/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e476qe9lmkos1zngry2ws630uqjbid2x8e28vh3wtse&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g\"></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Soooo...

This, however, does not mean that it has no impact on institutions based outside of the union. 😱 Any investment manager, European or not, who wishes to market their product to potential clients within the EU must follow the rules set out by the directive. 😮</span><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/portlet_file_entry/2995521/2-19052020-BP-EN.pdf/bb14f7f9-fc26-8aa1-60d4-7c2b509dda8e\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EU comprising the third-largest economy in the world</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (behind the US and China), it is an attractive market &ndash; therefore, it is very plausible that we&rsquo;ll also see many overseas companies disclose their sustainability risks and impacts in the near future.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Yeah, but why do </strong><strong><em>I</em></strong><strong> need to care about this? </strong><strong>🤷</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because you are a responsible investor. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🤓 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You could be a value driver by making a positive impact through your investment. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👏 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, from a risk and return point of view, the investee companies with exposure in energy inefficient real estate are more prone to physical (e.g., flooding) and transitional risk (change in regulation). Energy efficiency means taking all the E(environment), S(Social) and G(Governance) aspects and risks into consideration, and making these structures resilient to physical and transient risk. So, it is always prudent to evaluate your portfolio and see the ranking of investee companies.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SFDR will encourage the investee companies who are borrowing money in the capital market to improve their sustainability performance by aligning with predetermined disclosure templates. So, you can use these templates to make an investment which has ESF objectives. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">💪</span></p> <p><br /><br /></p>","a_creation":"1/10/2022","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.

How do we know if these companies are really making efforts for the environment, society and sustainability or just for the benefits of greenwashing? </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🤨 Let&rsquo;s find out!</span></p> <p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/p6qWfRJ4RxltUEmrl9/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47cnysnz94rr36lga7aqqr2h0b3obxtw64q4re660d&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g\"></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👉</span> <strong>What is a B-Corp?</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">B-Corp is similar to an organic certificate for food products in Europe or fair-trade certificate for producers in the developing countries, only it is a label for the business entities. It is a certification issued by B-Lab, a voluntary non-profit making organization, for companies who are making profit. B-lab is based in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Who is given this certificate? </strong><strong>🤔</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies are given a B-Corp certificate depending on whether they are meeting the conditions below </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👇</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">✅</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accountability: The board of directors or the management must consider the impact of the company on all the shareholders or the owners whose money is invested in the company.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">✅ </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transparency: The Certified B-corporations are required to make and publish report about their economic and social performance and of course this will be assessed by a third party</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">✅ </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Performance: The companies need to perform well in the B-lab assessment criteria.

Till now only 5500 corporations worldwide are certified with B-Corp certifications in around 84 countries in 177 different industries.</span></p> <p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/b8RfbQFaOs1rO10ren/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47co22bw9r6e88qod9rviny6fuwqn1fq8kb9uoyj1h&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g\"></p><p><strong>So, how can a company get this certificate in two days? </strong><strong>🤓</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whoah, hold your horses!! It is not an online certificate a company can get instantly. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">😮 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The time and process will depend on the structure of the company. It is easier and less time-consuming for a smaller company as compared to a large one. This is because the evaluation process for a large company would involve a large set of data and systems which will be checked.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company or corporation needs to do a few things before it can call itself a B-corporation:</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👉</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do the </span><strong>B impact assessment</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for itself.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👉 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improve on how the company is governed by using the </span><strong>legal requirement tool.</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👉</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fill the</span><strong> Disclosure Questionnaire.</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👉 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go through the </span><strong>Evaluation</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><strong>Verification </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">phase, where B Lab global evaluate the structure of the company, involvement in any controversial industries and submit supporting documents for the answers.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👉 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After verification, congrats! You can claim to be a B-corporation.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👉</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This certificate must be renewed every three years.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👉 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The B-Corp organizations have an impact business model.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong>Lmao ok, nerds. What does that all mean in normal English? 🤨</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, in simple words when a company takes resources from the society or environment to make a product, accountability and transparency with regard to their impact is required. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">☝️</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This certificate is an evaluation of a company in five </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🖐</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> different categories, i.e., community, environment, customers, workers, governance. This certificate increases the brand and market value of a company, even though this certificate does not have a legal validity or status.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, with the B-Corp label, it would be easier for you as an impactor to filter the companies as per your choice of impact.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/9U8vFgk0fD1OE/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47mdenx4zupayjw09hcfxa65g7689vj9hcvpsmv190&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g\"></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Who can apply for it? </strong><strong>🧐</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any business entity small or big, proprietorship, partnership, or a company can apply for it. There are different assessment criteria to give them certifications though. The business set up who wants to work not just for profit but also to make an impact in the community, in the society, they can apply for this certificate.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>I guess that&rsquo;s all kind of nice&hellip; But why should </strong><strong><em>I</em></strong><strong> care?</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🤷&zwj;♂️</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because it is easier for retail investors to join a global community of changemakers who are making an impact in sustainable communities and the environment. These labels can be checked by the investor for choosing a financial product in the similar way a fair trade certificate is checked for buying a consumer product. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🙌 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These labels are indicators of highest-level transparency, accountability, and impact of companies on social and environmental factors. So, it&rsquo;s easy for you as an investor, just search for the above symbol and relax. Someone else has done the background check for the companies.</span></p> <p><br /><br /></p>","a_creation":"1/10/2022","a_disclaimer":"We are not financial advisors, and we do not claim any responsibility for the financial choices you may make on the basis of what you read in this blog.
